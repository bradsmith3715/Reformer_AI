      "content": "[Music]\nhey guys my name is Nell today we'll be\ndoing an all-over body workout on the\nreformer I've been teaching these\nprograms for 15 years and they\nsuccessfully progress you through the\nPilates repertoire I really hope you\nenjoy now let's get started\nokay let's start with VMO series your\nfeeder in a V position toes on the bar\nheels together okay you're pushing it\nout and in really squeezing the heels\ntogether and we're doing 20 of these\nquite fast making sure that you return\nthe carriage without banging the\ncarriage back into the stopper so you've\nreally got to engage the front the back\nand the inside of the legs as you push\nout and in pelvic stability so a gentle\nlift of the pelvic floor a gentle\ndrawing down of the abdominals down\ntowards the spine but keep the spine in\na neutral position fully straighten the\nlegs when you straighten them and now\ninto VMO knock-knees okay so your toes\nare exactly where they are you push out\nkeeping the knees together go all the\nway back into the stopper and then\nwithin that range you're going to do 20\nof these so the knees are together\nthroughout the whole of the exercise the\ntoes are on the bar as they were in the\nV position but then the heels are out\nwider so it's like a knocked knee this\nreally gets into the muscles on the\ninside of the knees and the inside of\nthe legs in through the nose out through\nthe mouth\nexpanding the ribs and then contracting\nthe abdominals keeping the muscles in\nthe legs engaged throughout prehensile\nplayers now bring your legs together so\nyour ankles your knees your incyde\nthighs are together and the bar is on\nthe arch of the foot wrap your toes\naround and then out in 20 of these\nreally squeeze the back of the legs\nsqueeze the knees together shoulders are\nback and down stabilizing the torso by\nimprinting the arms back and down you'll\nstart to really feel this in the legs\nwe're doing 20 of these keep wrapping\nthe toes around the bar strengthening\nthe muscles are underneath the toes out\nthrough the mouth in through the nose\ncontrolling the bed in control the bed\nin and now toes on the bar ankles knees\nlegs together so straighten your legs\nand then bend halfway down now hold that\nlittle squat and then you lower and lift\nthe heels down and up so the bed's about\n20 centimetres away from the stopper and\nthen the challenge here is to keep the\ncarriage still as you lower and lift\nyour heels ankles knees inside thighs\nare glued together you've got a control\nthe carriage by engaging your quads and\nyour hamstrings in an isometric\ncontraction so a held contraction here\npelvic floor deep abdominals to finish\nfully straighten the legs and then lower\nthe heels down and then straight into\ncalf raises imagine there's a magnet\nbetween your ankles your knees and your\ngroin the big toe joints are touching\nstrengthening the soles of the feet and\nthe cards and then really stretch\nthrough your posture and then into\nprances so one at a time the challenge\nhere is to keep the pelvis very still so\nyou don't want to swing your hips around\nwhen the heel lowers down articulate\nthrough the ankle joint really lift the\nheels up and then lower the heel down\nimagine you're looking over a neighbor's\nfence you want to go right up check in\nto your neck and your shoulders have a\nlittle stretch at the end of those and\nthen return with control\nso now widen your legs the foot is in\nline with your sit bone and we're doing\na toe develop a so you straighten the\nlegs and then return underneath the bar\nX\nstand the legs and then return with\nlength put your thumbs on your ribs and\nyour fingers on your hip bones you want\nto keep both sides of your waist nice\nand long so you don't want to hitch one\nhip up and rock your tail left and right\nkeeping the pelvis very still as the\npriority and don't worry about how high\nthe leg lifts okay so if you need to\nextend your leg leg out a little lower\non a diagonal then obviously do that so\n14 is in line with your sit bone extend\nthe legs and then return using the\nabdominals\nsqueeze the kneecaps up and then engage\nthe abdominals so we're strengthening\nyour thighs here but also that's\nsupporting leg that left leg that's on\nthe bar we want to feel like you're\npressing that thigh bone down towards\nthe floor just strengthen the back of\nthe legs if your leg doesn't go straight\nup like that just reach it out on an\nangle maintaining a neutral nice still\npelvis you've got a little hollow in the\nlower back and now we're doing heel Jake\nthe peg so the heels in line with the\nsit bone the other leg is up towards the\nceiling or there abouts you lower down\nand then return now imagine the inside\nthighs almost glued together they're\nmoving as one unit this is a pelvic\nstability exercise so you want to be\nable to do this movement in the legs\nwithout rocking tucking the pelvis or\nthe lower back the tail bones down is a\nlittle hollow in the lower back and then\nheel in line with the sit bone other leg\nup energy out through the legs breathing\nout through the mouth and then in\nthrough the nose out through the mouth\nand then in through the nose may want to\nplace the hands on the hips of the bones\nof the pelvis there making sure that\nthey stay even like you've got a spirit\nlevel from left to right hip\nstabilizing through your torso and your\nshoulder girdle by imprinting the\nshoulders back and down but lifting the\npelvic floor and belly up pick your\nprogram here and then we're going to put\nthe headrest down we're going into\nsemicircle prep and reverse toes on the\nbar heels together so your feet are in a\nV position knees are hip bone width\napart you're going to tuck your tail\nunder roll up press the carriage out\nroll down through the spine maintaining\nthe carriage still and then return the\ncarriage back into the stopper try and\nkeep the carriage as close to the\nstopper as you can only push out sort of\n3/4 of the way so you can roll down and\nkeep the carriage still reach the knees\nup and away from your hips pressing out\nlengthening the front of the hips and\nthen roll down with the length and then\nreturn stabilizing through the shoulders\npressing the heels together as you\nreverse it so tuck your tail under and\nroll all the way out return the bed back\ninto the stop I keep the bed into the\nstopper and roll down through the spine\nagain pressing out and neutral tuck your\ntail under lift the hips all the way up\nreturn using the back of the legs keep\nthe bed in the stopper and roll back\ndown and we'll do one more of these so\nreally strengthens the back of the legs\nit articulates your spine working the\ninside thighs as well by keeping the\nknees hip bone width apart and now we're\ngoing into mini pulses so hands clasp\nbehind your head you're going to lift\nthe shoulders up and then lift and then\na little lower lift to the height little\nlower lift and lower\nso imagine there's a skewer going\nthrough your right ribcage through out\nthrough the left ribcage and you're\npivoting around that skewer so drawing\nthe ribs down towards the hips and then\ninto obliques so there's a very small\nleaf\nthe right shoulder up it's not too\ntwisted over to the left so both\nshoulders are lifting but more so the\nright working the waist working the\nobliques keep the abdominals flat and\nthen obliques with the left shoulder\nlifting really feel like you're\nstretching the spine away and up like a\nwave going out through the crown of the\nhead lengthening out through the spine\nand then into double toe taps so you're\ngoing to lower the carves down towards\nthe foot bar and then lift it back up\nfocusing on keeping the pelvis very\nstill activate the back of the legs\nmaybe have a little poke at the back of\nthe legs\nI only lower the legs down within a\nrange you can keep your tummy flat if\nyour tummy's puffing out you're lowering\nthe legs too low have the arms just up\nabove the hip bones at the side there\nand now into hip rolls with extension so\ngrab hold of the shoulder s saw the\nlittle rods there you roll and extend\nthe legs roll only within a range that\nyou can keep the opposite shoulder down\nand using the abdominals to roll and\nthen keep your thighs still as you\nextend the legs out and then back to\nCenter we want to keep the shoulder\ngirdle at the back they're very stable\nrotating the belly button but keeping\nthe chest and the breastplate straight\nup towards the ceiling as best you can\nso it's not about going down really low\ninhale exhale inhale exhale imagine the\nankles knees and inside thighs are glued\ntogether then place the feet down have a\nlittle breather rolling on to the side\nthere we're going to do a spring change\nhere so we're doing either\none-and-a-half Springs or one spring\nwe're about to go into abdominals so if\nyou get quite Nikki then go for a\nlighter spring so maybe one full spring\nif you're feeling a bit stronger than\nwhy\nand a half Springs but only do that if\nit doesn't get into your neck we're\ndoing lat pulldown series with a single\nleg stretch so start with a bit a little\nbit away from the stopper arms directly\nabove the shoulders knees up into\ntabletop pull the arms down reach one\nleg out over the bar and then return now\nonly lower the arms down within a range\nthat you can imprint the shoulder blades\nflash at the back and we're lengthening\nthe leg out within a range that you feel\nlike your abdominals are holding the leg\nrather than the lower back and then you\nadd in a little curl up out through the\nmouth in through the nose really\nimportant that when you're doing your\nhands in strap work that you're lifting\nyour head up from the mid-back muscles\nso you really that armpit muscles are\nsqueezing down and that's what helps you\nbrace and support your neck and then\ninto T arm so the arms are out wide\ndrawing the little fingers in towards\nyour sides\nhaving the elbows slightly bent to help\nyou activate the mid-back muscles\nbreathe it out through the mouth in\nthrough the nose out through the mouth\nnow you can keep doing that otherwise\nyou start to add in about6 curl ups as\nwell pressing from the armpits through\nto the hands so your necks not doing all\nthe work if it gets to Nikki you keep\nyour head down until you build up your\nstrength around your upper body in your\nabs and then inter triceps so the elbows\nare just up off the carriage keep the\nelbows still focusing on nipping the\nshoulders back and down stabilizing and\nstrengthening through the back muscles\nthe mid-back muscles and the abdominals\nnow you can keep your head down or you\ncan add in a little curl up now really\nreach the hands towards the foot bar so\nyou lift your head and your chest up\nlifting up lifting the shoulders up by\npressing and reaching the hands away\nfrom you\nreturn the bed back into the stopper and\nthen place one foot down followed by the\nother now have a rest to slow long\nbreaths inhale through the nose out\nbreath relax breathe in through the nose\nbreathe out through the mouth okay so\nstart with the bed away from the stop\nour hands up above your shoulders keep\nthe bed still lift one leg up followed\nby the other hundreds Bend and stretch\nyou're going to lift the head and the\nchest up the arms are up above the hips\nhip bones at the side there and then\npulse the arms straighten the legs for\nfive pulses bend the legs for five out\ntwo three four five in two three four\nfive if it starts to get really Nikki\npush the hands into the straps even more\nso that once again you're using your\nlats the muscles underneath your armpits\npulling your shoulders down to support\nyour neck if it gets to Nikki put your\nhead down reaching inside thighs imagine\nthere's a magnet between the ankles the\nknees and the groin and then return the\nbed back to the stop place one leg down\nfollowed by the other have a little rest\nbed away from the stopper arms up knees\nup into tabletop legs slightly apart now\nwe're doing obliques with extension so\nthe hand goes over the pelvis the other\nhand goes on the outside of the leg the\nknees are above the hips working the\nobliques energy out through the arms and\nconstantly even on the return you're\npressing the hands into the stop eye so\nyou're controlling the equipment\npressing against the straps and then\nresisting against the straps\nhave a little rest and then we're going\ninto coordination better away from the\nstopper arms up lift one leg up followed\nby the other so lift your head and your\nchest up straighten the legs open and\nclose and then return to the start\nposition extend the legs out open close\nand return breathe it out to lift up and\nthen breathing in to return that's where\nthe coordination factor is breathe out\nto lift up and open close breathing in\nto return once again keep your hands up\nabove your hips at the side there so not\ntoo flat down towards the carriage\nthat'll help you really curve through\nthe upper body and just do what you can\nfour of these have a rest and then\nanother two or you can do six and then\nhave a rest and then another two or H or\nup to ten bring the bed back into the\nstop I place your feet down and then\nroll onto your side to get up and then\ndo a spring change so either\none-and-three-quarter Springs or\none-and-a-half we're going to do feet in\nstraps have some Pilates balls handy and\nthen we're going to put your feet in the\nstrap so pressing the carriage out put\none foot through the strap hold the\ncarriage still with the knee bend and\nthen lift the other leg up we're doing\nfrogs with the Pilates ball feeding of\nthe e position heels together toes apart\nand then place the ball between the\nheels start with the knees above your\nhips but they're open and then you\nextend and then bend the pelvis is in\nneutral the lower back is still breathe\nit out through the mouth in through the\nnose the challenge here is to keep the\nball very still you don't want to roll\nthe ball left and right so this really\nbrings up any imbalance in the inside\nthigh muscles if you've got one that's\nreally dominant then that will roll the\nball and then we're going to do it\nsmaller Pilates balls as the balls get\nsmaller it gets harder to control start\nwith the knees above the hips but the\nknees are out wider than the straps feet\nnuran and V position pelvis in neutral\nextend the legs out and then Bend you\nmight want to place the hands on the\nbelly making sure that when your legs\nare extended out that the belly is not\npuffing up you want to exhale draw the\nbelly flat so we're getting into that\ndeep layer of abdominals pelvic floor is\ngently lifted to help stabilize your\nlower back ten of these fantastic for\nthe inside thighs and pelvic stability\nso then into circles start with the legs\nup towards the ceiling but only within a\nrange that you can keep your pelvis on\nthe carriage in parallel we're doing\ncircles so that you lift up open down\nand together so you can do anywhere\nbetween five to ten of these in parallel\nand then keep doing the circles in the\nsame direction but in external rotation\nso this gets more the external rotation\ngets into the deep glute and hip muscles\nand just notice is the parallel the\nturned out more challenging for you and\ndepending on our leg alignment that will\nbring up any imbalance there and then\nreverse the circle once again in\nparallel first do anywhere between five\nto ten in parallel maintaining the\npelvis nice and still you don't want to\nflatten and lift the lower back imagine\nyour fingers are underneath the lower\nback there and you're maintaining that\nheight and then same direction but in\nexternal rotation in turnout back of the\nlegs and abdominals back of the legs and\nabdominals keep spiraling wrapping each\nthigh bone out\nit's like barbershop spirals rolling\noutwards to get into those deep muscles\nat the back of the pelvis there that\nturn our legs out now low opening so the\nlegs start out wide draw them together\nand then open them back out pressing the\nfeed into the straps and then resisting\non the way out breathing out through the\nmouth draw the legs together breathing\nin to open back out flex the feet and\nthen point the feet\nthat's too much if that's going to cramp\nyour feet then you just keep your legs\nyou feed at a natural position that\nfeels alright for you and we're focusing\non pressing from the sit bones through\nto the heels the back of the legs and\nthis gives you a lovely length up out of\nthe lower back have a little rest by\nhaving the legs together on a diagonal\nand then you grab hold of both straps\nand just have a little rest there that\nfeels quite nice just give your body a\nlittle pause and then we're going in to\nbig frog so you start in a frog position\nokay you're gonna open your legs out\nwide pause for a breath and then draw\nthe legs together over the bar and then\nbend open the legs out and then move the\ncarriages the legs draw together and\nthen return to frog the challenge here\nis to open the legs out without the\ncarriage moving and then press from the\nback of the legs and the inside thighs\npelvic stability open the legs out\nimagine your ankles being gently pulled\nout away from the hips and then draw\nthem together and then we reverse it\nhang on one more breathing into your\nribcage and then pressing from the back\nof the legs\nbe careful listen to your inside thighs\nhere only go at a height that feels safe\non your legs and then reverse it so you\ndo a frog you open the legs out wide the\ncarriage will move bend your knees and\ndraw the heels together reach the legs\nover the bar\nopen the legs out the carriage will move\npause their length and out through your\nlegs and then keep the carriage still as\nyou draw your heels together and bend\nyour knees lengthen out through the\nlower back stabilizing with the back of\nthe legs the carriage moves as you\nstraighten and open now keep the\ncarriage still as you pause and draw the\nheels together stabilizing your lower\nback with your breath pelvic floor deep\nabdominals and then have a little rest\nonce again the legs together hold on to\nboth straps in the center and then high\nopening so your legs are up towards the\nceiling only lift the legs up within a\nrange that you once again you can keep\nthe pelvis on the carriage you don't\nwant your bottom and tail lifted right\nup okay\nnow whatever height your legs are the\nchallenge is to then keep the carriage\nuh very still so you've got to keep the\ncarriage still by pressing the feet into\nthe straps enough to keep the carriage\nstill but not so much that it moves the\ncarriage and then you pause there and\nbreathe ok keep pushing the feet gently\ninto the strap so that the back of the\nlegs are engaged breathe into the\nribcage pelvic floor navel to spine and\nthen draw the legs up now we're going\ninto short spine put the headrest down\nand keep your neck straight here so do\nnot look at the camera or the screen or\nwhatever while you're doing this okay\nkeep your neck straight roll all the way\nup turn the legs out bend your knees and\nthen roll down through the spine return\nthe legs back to frog straighten the\nlegs in frog the heels are together toes\nare apart now bring the legs into\nparallel draw the bed all the way into\nthe stopper with control keep the bed\ninto the stopper as you roll up through\nyour spine\nthe legs out bend the knees and then\nslowly roll through the spine and then\nreturn the legs back to frog and again\nin the side thighs fold at the hips get\na nice stretch in the back of the legs\nnow as you roll up if it's really hard\nfor you to roll up you probably need a\nlittle bit of a stronger spring or you\njust keep doing the short spine prep\nwhich is in the beginner to program tuck\nthe tail under as you roll up using the\nback of the legs and your abdominals\nkeep reaching through your legs as you\nturn the legs out and Bend and then\nopening up in between the spiney the\nbony protrusions of your spine tummy\ninside thighs fold of the hip keep the\nbed in the stopper as you roll up using\nthe abdominals reaching up out of the\nspine\nkeeping the legs together here press the\nankles the knees the inside thighs\ntogether as you roll up opening up the\nback of your legs as you roll down\nyou\nreally lengthening up and out of the\nshoulders keep reaching it up and out of\nthe shoulders as you turn the legs out\nand you bend your knees keep breathing\nnaturally opening and softening your\nspine return to neutral extend the legs\nout and then we're going to hop off\nthere so you take one foot out of the\nstrap and then the other leg and then\nhave a glute stretch here so ankle\nacross your thigh grab hold of the shin\nyou might want to put your foot against\nthe foot bar to help you stretch\notherwise it's floating in space and\nyour arms are drawing your shin towards\nyour chest\nsend the breath down into the hip and\nthen exhale relax your shoulders just\ntake the time to stretch your hips out a\nlot of us spend the majority of our time\nsitting down so those muscles get very\ntight so just spend the time stretching\nthe hips out here and having a little\nrest and active rest and then you roll\nonto your hip and lift the opposite hip\nup stretching out different fibers and\nthen back through Center and then\nswapping legs breathing into your ribs\ninto your lungs breathing out folding at\nthe hips one breath at a time taking the\ntime to stretch your hips out and then\nmaybe roll onto your right hip lifting\nthe left hip up a little bit and then\nback through Center rolling onto your\nside to get up\nwe're going to put one spring on so one\nfull spring on take the others off\nstand up on the carriage we're doing a\nlunge put one foot the left foot against\nthe shoulder rest and then whack the\nother leg up on the bar and then\npressing the carriage out so that you're\nfeeling a stretch in the front of your\nleft hip the right knee is above the\nright ankle engage the left buttocks and\nthen lengthen your chest out away from\nyour hip so your spine is straight\npelvic floor deep abdominals and then\nkeeping the carriage as still as you can\nyou start to straighten your right leg\nlooking down towards the leg or maybe\nstraightening your spine out to a flat\nback or maybe dropping your head down\nreturn the bed back into the stopper and\nthen switch legs so right foot against\nthe shoulder rest shift your weight onto\nyour right hand put the left foot up\nwhere the left hand was and then you\npress the carriage out knee the left\nknee is above the ankle keep the left\nheel slightly lifted so that the muscles\nare engaged around your ankle and then\nfocus on the right hip engage the right\nbuttock so that the stretch the right\nhip\nstraighten your leg just to a point that\nyou feel comfortable if this spring\nfeels too light then you can always put\none-and-a-half Springs on to make it\nmore supportive pausing there and\nbreathing now return the bed back into\nthe stopper and then put that left foot\ndown hop off there we're going into\nscooter so I like to use the Box here if\nyou don't have a big box like this you\ncan stack some some big books or\nsomething that you can step on to it\ndoesn't have to be as high as my box but\njust to lift you up a little so that\nyour pelvis can be even when you do this\nokay so screw to with a flat back so\nyour spine is straight pressing back\nthrough the left leg with the back of\nthe leg contracting the back of the leg\nas the\nreturn the carriage returns back into\nthe stop Oh your right arm is out to the\nside so your obliques are really working\nhere now put right hand down left arm\nout keeping the spine nice and still the\nweight is back towards the heels and\nyou're pressing through the heels here\nout through the mouth in through the\nnose stabilizing through the lower back\nand then curve the spine open the right\narm out straighten them been pushing a\ncarriage back with a spine curve now\nreally sit back on your heels so much so\nthat you could lift your left hand off\nthe bar you want to feel like you're\ntucking your pubic bone towards your\nchest opening up the lower back and\nscooping the belly and maintain that\nthen left arm out to the side\npressing back heaps away into the hill\nso much so you could lift the hand off\nkeep tucking your pubic bone towards\nyour face and then stabilize through\nyour shoulders so really wrap your\nshoulders around and down keeping a very\nstill through your torso moving the left\nleg and then other side so you're going\nto step off the Box around you go place\nthe Box in line with the carriage step\nonto the Box the foot is in line with\nthem and all other carriage you start\nwith a carriage a little bit away from\nthe stopper knees it even left arm out\nto the side and then you push through\nyour right leg the challenge here is to\nkeep the buttocks contracted throughout\nexhale inhale exhale inhale keeping very\nstill through the supporting leg your\ntorso your shoulders and then swapping\nhands so right arm out to the side the\nshoulders are still there pull down\nyour pelvis is still making sure both\nsides of the waist a long and lengthened\nengaging the supporting leg and engaging\nthe back of your right leg stabilizing\nthrough the pelvis now put both hands on\nthe bar tuck your tail under look\ntowards your belly really scoop and\nhollow out your belly and then shift\nyour weight all the way back test it by\nlifting your right arm off and then C\ncurving while you're doing this scooter\nall the weight is into the heels and you\nonly push the carriage back within a\nrange so you can keep the pelvis tucked\nand the C curve through the spine and\nhunch the shoulders swapping sides so\nleft arm on the bar right arm out to the\nside shifting the weight all the way\nback onto the heels keeping the C curve\nbut then activating the back of the leg\nout through the mouth in through the\nnose keep the buttocks engaged both\nhands on the bar and then lifting up so\nput the Box to the side\nwe've got one spring on now we're doing\nelephant with a leg lift so now we're\ngoing to add on half a spring so you've\ngot one and a half Springs on the\ncarriage\nokay so hands shoulder-width apart heels\nagainst the shoulder s toes lifted and\nthen try and have a flat back now draw\nyour left leg over through the shoulder\ns and up and keep both legs parallel you\nwant both hips and shoulders square so\nwhat you need to do is you need to push\nyour right hand into the bar like you're\npushing the bar away from you and then\nyou pull the left hand like you're\ntrying to pull the left side of the bar\ntowards you then swap side so you push\nwith your right hand pull with your left\nto help you stabilize make sure both\nhips are square so it could put a spirit\nlevel at the back of your pelvis there\nand it'd be nice and still engaging your\nthigh\nreaching out through the leg inside\nthighs are still drawing together even\nthough they're slightly apart draw the\nbed back in so that was with one and a\nhalf Springs now we're going to lash in\nthe spring and do exactly the same thing\nand I want you to feel this more in your\nabdominals now so before it was more a\nstrengthening this is more a subtle deep\nabdominal connection now so now we're\nmoving the leg nice and slippery in the\nhip but really focusing on all\nabdominals and thigh all abdominals and\nthighs drawing the leg in once again\nyou're pushing the hand the right hand\ninto the bar pulling with the left\nkeeping the torso and the arms very\nstill as you move and isolate that leg\nand then back through Center other side\nso you lift the right leg up pushes the\nright hand pull the left\nstabilize the hips inside thighs are\nsqueezing towards one another out\nthrough the mouth in through the nose\ndeep abdominals tummy muscles are\ndrawing the bed back in keep the toes\nlift it just stretch the sciatic nerve\ntorso arms shoulders very still return\nback to the start position now have a\nlittle stretch see just imagine I've got\nhold of your pelvis and I'm pulling you\nback drop your head down have a little\nstretch so now we're going in to we're\ngoing to put one-and-a-half Springs on\nso you're gonna add that half spring on\nagain so we've got one and a half\nSprings up stretch to the heels lift it\nup on the shoulder s you're reaching\nyour pelvis back so it's like a downward\nfacing dog\nyou can have your knees bent or legs\nstraight now you push the carriage out\ninto a plank position and then you\nreturn the bed back into the stopper to\nthe star position okay you can have your\nknees bent there if you need otherwise\nstraighten them now pivot in the\nshoulder joint in the hip joint here you\nwant to keep the arms as still on that\ndiagonal as possible and then you pivot\naround that joint the arms should not\ndrop as you push the carriage out the\nchallenge here is to keep the arm bone\nstill in space as you draw the carriage\nin and out going from a plank to a\npyramid or a downward facing dog\nposition so you're pressing out engaging\nyour core pull your armpits down towards\nyour hips and then you draw the bed back\nin using your abdominals and your thighs\nout through the mouth in through the\nnose take half a spring off we're doing\none spring exactly the same thing so\nthis is much lighter it's going to be\nless about upper body strength now and\nit's going to be more about core deep\nmuscles same principles apply you want\nto keep the arms and the shoulders very\nstill and you pivot around the arm and\nshoulder joint pressing out within a\nrange that you don't hollow in your\nlower back and sink the pelvis down so\nonly push out within a range you feel\nyour abdominals supporting you and then\ndeep abdominals and thighs back in the\nlegs are apart even so engage the inside\nthighs imagine the inside thighs are\ndrawing towards one another\nkeep the collarbones away from the ears\nand then press the bed into the stopper\nand in return add a spring on now we're\ndoing one and a half Springs up stretch\nthree you press the carriage out into\nthat plank you draw the carriage forward\nyou press back out and then you return\nback to the stopper breathe it out to go\ninto plank breathing into pivot forward\nbreathing out to go back into plank\nbreathing in to return back all the way\nback into the stop I use your abdominals\nand your arms and your legs there\nso press out lengthen lengthen lengthen\nover the bar press back out challenging\nyour core this is very much so on this\nspring uses your arms okay we're using\nthe arms the deltoids and then we're\nusing the lats the muscles around the\nside of the ribs and then abdominals\nhere light in the spring so you take\nhalf a spring off now we've got one\nspring on start with the bed into the\nstopper you roll your knuckles forward\nlike that to lift you up out of your\nwrists the bed is pressing into the\nstopper here you press out to a plank\nyou go forward forward forward you press\nback and then return keeping the arms\nstill in space and then you move the\narms and then you move the arms keep\nthem still in space return back to the\nstopper abdominals here arms arms and\nthen abdominals and guys once again the\nlegs are apart but energetically you're\ndrawing the inside thighs together\nparticularly here as you draw the bed\nback into the stopper and\nremember to go all the way back into the\nstopper to get that last little inch of\ncontraction in the tummy and the thighs\nhopefully you're feeling nice and sweaty\nlike I am here that's all we want\nworking the body out but in a calm way\nhands on the bar down stretch prep start\nwith the carriage away from the stop a\nbit in a deep sea curve so look towards\nyour pelvis tuck your pelvis towards\nyour face and your abdominals and\nimprinting your lower back so you press\nthey carried out within a range that you\ncan maintain the upper body very still\npressing the carriage out until your\nthighs almost touch and then screw back\nin I'm trying to give you a better\ndemonstration of that scoop here but my\ntop keeps doing weird things anyway so\npush the carriage out you start with the\ncarriage away from the stopper in the\nc-curve and then you press the carriage\nas far back as possible without it going\ninto your lower back and then draw the\ncarriage back in by tucking the pelvis\nunder press the carriage out and then\ndeep abdominals draw the carriage in\ninhale and then exhale you can actually\ndo either breathing here you can breathe\nit out to push out if that helps you\nfeel like more stable in your lower back\notherwise you can breathe in and then\nbreathe out to return remember keep your\ncollar bones away from the ears pressing\nthe armpits down towards the floor so\nyour shoulder blades can widen and\nstabilize bring the bed back into the\nstop ah mermaid give\nwrists a little rest there okay that\nseries is very risky but over time\nyou'll build up that strength as long as\nyou keep the the space underneath your\npalm slightly lifted whenever you're\ndoing weight-bearing work on the bar\npress the carriage out curving to the\nright and then rotate the left hand\ntowards the bar return the hand back\nover the head and then return the bed\nback into the stopper lift up reach over\nand then return back to the start\nposition the bed starts a little bit\naway from the stopper and the arm is out\nc-curve over to the right one try and\nkeep the bed as still as possible as you\nrotate the left hand to return back to\nthat side bend three back into the\ncarriage grab hold of your shin bicep to\nnose lift up and over and then hand on\nthe bar in line with you torso and maybe\na little bit further arm straight again\nreaching up and over rotate collarbones\naway from the ear breathe into the back\nof your ribs there this is very much so\nmobilizes the thoracic spine where your\nribs connect to your spine and if the\nnose to bicep doesn't feel good on your\nneck you can do what I'm doing here\nwhich is facing the screen still lift\nthe left ribcage up rotate breathe into\nthe mid-back lift the left ribcage up\nreturn back to the stopper reaching up\nand over lengthening out of your hips\nand your spine and then return other\nsides here no Zed's it shins towards the\nshoulder rests you might even want to\nroll that calf open start with a bit\naway from the stopper over you go rotate\ntry and keep the bed still pressing the\nright hip down as you draw the right\nshoulder forward and then square back up\ndraw the bed back into the stopper grab\nhold of your outside\nin nose to bicep and then lift up and\nout the nose to bicep gives you a length\nup out of your spine laterally flexing\nthrough the thoracic and then pivot\naround breathe into your mid-back rotate\nback through Center\nup and over lengthening out return hand\non the bar bit away from the stopper\nlaterally flex keeping the hips as\nsquare to the front as you can as you\nrotate your collarbones towards the bar\nand then square back up return and then\nlifting up and out of the ribs one more\nbreathing into the ribcage rotate draw\nthe belly in as you press the right hand\ninto the bar square back up navel to\nspine return and then deep abdominals\nlifting up and out of the lower the\nlower back and then return\nfeels so good on you thoracic spine\nparticularly if we're sitting in front\nof the computer hunched forward over the\nover the um computer we're doing short\nbox series now so you put the short box\nagainst the shoulder ESTs feet\nunderneath the straps flex your feet and\nseparate your legs you can put some\nSprings on just to keep the carriage in\nat the stopper you perch towards the\nfront of the box now a roll back lift\nyour arms up above your head\ndraw them forward see curve and then\nstraighten your spine up lower back is\nimprinting towards the box arms go over\nin like a diamond then bring them back\nto genie seeker forward and then\nlengthen up deep abdominals imprint keep\nthe deep abdominals lifting the chest\nslightly and then up and over stretching\nyour lower back and then lift up out of\nthat deep abdominals tucking imprint\nflexing the feet so your thighs and the\nback of the legs are working here as\nwell now hands on your furrowed flat\nback with a reach hinge back reach the\narms up hands to Feraud and return\nhinging back keep that hinge as you\nlengthen hands to fired return so\nstabilize through your shoulders as you\nreach the arms out shoulder width apart\nthen hands to forward\nreturn so you go from your sit bones to\nthe back of your coccyx thighs\nhamstrings are engaged the back of the\nlegs hinging back keep lifting up out of\nyour chest keep lengthening through your\nspine and then tilt with a hip hike lift\nthe right hip up lower the right hip\ndown return with length laterally flex\nlift the hip lower the hip down and then\nreturn to sitting breathe in breathe out\nbreathe in breathe out deep abdominals\nbreathe in our focus is the obliques\nlower the hip down\nand lift twist with a hinge rotate hinge\nback return rotate hinge return keep the\nbelly button forward as you rotate your\nchest rotate the chest hinging back and\nimagine there's a pole up through the\nspine there you want to try and keep\nyour necklace elongated and in line with\nyour spine as possible target area is\nthe torso abdominal muscles just\nchecking the program he are into side so\nyour right foot is in the strap you foot\nis flexed and the foot is pushing up so\nthe outside of your right leg is working\nhands on the head you're on a diagonal\nyou lower down and then up to the\ndiagonal you lift and return to the\ndiagonal keep the pelvis in your lower\nback as still as possible and it's like\nyou're pivoting around your your stomach\narea through the rib cage this is quite\na hard exercise if this is too much for\nyou then you go back to the sides on the\nBox in level 2 so laterally flexing and\nlifting up you're going through a\ndiagonal plane throughout you keep\nlengthening up out of that diagonal\nplane pivoting around your stomach if\nthere was a skewer going through your\nstomach right out through your back at\nthe back there you're pivoting around\nthat area keep lengthening up and out\nyou should not feel this in your lower\nback if you're feeling it in your lower\nback your top hip is rolled too far\nforward so roll it back a little and\nbring it into the ABS and if that was\ntoo hard then you just do the level two\nversion\nlong box place the box in a long box\nposition put the foot bar down we're\ndoing pulling straps one two and triceps\nchest is off the edge the legs are out\nwide arms are forward on a diagonal and\nthe thoracic spine is flexed forward\nyou're breathing out to swipe the arms\nby your side really draw your shoulders\nback and then forward okay so you go\nfrom a neutral position to a flexed\nforward position I like to do this still\nwithout using the straps because this is\nvery challenging exercise to do properly\nI find if you use the straps too early\nthen it gets to Nikki okay we need to\nisolate those spine muscles mid back\nmuscles the legs are very active your\nkneecaps are lifting up the tailbone is\nanchoring down towards the box now arms\nout to a tee you go from a neutral to\nthoracic extension neutral to thoracic\nextension the legs are reaching out\ntowards the back and then your breast\nplate is reaching forward and up from\nthere keep the neck nice and long\nimagine someone's hands at the back of\nyour neck though so when you lift up\nthey're still length and the elongation\nat the back of the neck tummy muscles\nengaging now really feeling this in the\nback of the legs and the mid-back lower\nthe arms down now from a neutral\nposition triceps breathing out to\nstraighten the arms and you can do this\nin a thoracic extension as well or into\nneutral tuck the tailbone down towards\nthe floor engage your legs reach your\nlegs out of your hips the deep\nabdominals engaging the back the arms\nand then lower down have a big stretch\nplace their hands on the frames maybe\nswing your legs on the box like a horse\nand then see curved back scoop the belly\nin tuck your pubic bone and then hands\non the knees and lift your chest up it's\na little stretch there put the bar up to\nits normal height\nwe have either half a spring on or\nthree-quarters of a spring on if you've\ngot two heavier spring for this next\nexercise then it's really going to throw\nyour stability out so you want it quite\nlike one and a half or so half or\nthree-quarters chesses off the box hands\nare on the box bring your hands in to\nshoulder high shoulder distance I needed\nto move forward a bit there long box\nwith a single arm bring your hands in\ncloser towards your shoulder level and\nthen you lift up with one arm out to the\nside and then you lower back down\nbreathing in to lift up breathing out to\nreturn the challenge here is to keep\nsquare through your shoulders and your\nhips don't allow your left shoulder to\nroll don't allow your torso to rotate to\nthe right so in this one with a left arm\non the bar we don't want the torso\nyou've got to stabilize and press\nthrough shoulder blade like I did there\nas you lift up don't allow your\nshoulders to rotate and sink you're\nlifting the chest up keep pushing the\nhand into the bar so that you're really\nworking your lats on the left side and\nyour obliques hips are squares best you\ncan place the hands on the bar slowly\nreturn the bed back into the stopper\nswimming legs you can rest your chest\nno football or you have your chest just\noff and then swimming legs one at a time\nkeep the pelvis very still keep your\ntorso very still back of the legs\nworking you might want to do a little\nstretch here tuck under open up your bag\nand then thoracic extension lifting your\nbreast plate up and open\narms sitting chest expansion have your\nlegs either crossed over like a kid\nsitting in a classroom or the legs are\nout straight over the headrest hands\nthrough the straps spine is in neutral\npressing the arms by your side and then\ninhale return pressing the arms by so\nreally focusing on the shoulder blades\nand the muscles in between and\nunderneath the shoulder blades there\npressing the hands reaching the hands\ndown towards the floor so that you get\nthis lift up and out of your ribs\nstabilizing your neck with your shoulder\nblades biceps elbows in line with the\nfloor and then drawing the hands in and\nout within a range you can keep your\nelbows very still reaching the elbows\ntowards the wall that you're facing\nfeeling the wrap of the shoulder blades\ndown and wide deep abdominals supporting\nyou and shoulder blades pelvic floor is\ngently lifted helping you stabilize\nthrough your lower back triceps elbows\nin by your sides but they will be\nslightly apart so that you don't hit the\ncarriage the challenge here yes we're\nworking the triceps the back of the arms\nbut the challenge here is to maintain\ntorso and shoulder blade stability\nmaking sure that when you straighten\nyour arms your shoulders don't roll\nforward your arms don't roll forward and\nquite the opposite you want to feel like\nyou're actually like rolling them back\nto help them stay still rhomboids for\narms through the straps arms up elbows\nshoulder height pelvic floor navel to\nspine open the arms and then draw your\nshoulder blades together and then return\narms shoulder blades shoulder blades\narms arms draw and then drawing the\nshoulder blades together\nreally working the muscles in between\nyour shoulder blades here it's quite\nchallenging if it feels too hard do\nlighter and then it'll really target the\nright muscles if you've got the correct\nspring on postural muscles here drawing\nthe shoulder blades back helping us\nstrengthen up our shoulders to support\nour computer posture often we're very\nweak in between the shoulder blades\nthere well done that's a tough exercise\nturn around you keep hold of the straps\nand then just double check that you\nhaven't crossed the straps over there\nonce again the arms you're sitting scoop\nthe arms and then flip the hands so the\nelbows are up higher than the straps\nhands in line with your chest open and\nthen return this cord hugger tree\nimagine your arms are wrapping around a\nbig thick tree if you'd prefer to have\nyour legs straight and start to\nstraighten your legs out keeping the\ntorso very stable whilst you're moving\nyour arms is the challenge here we don't\nwant the spring so strong that you have\nto push forward with your torso keep\nlifting up and out of your pelvis\nlengthening up and out of your spine\nsalute\nflip the hands so the straps are up\nhigher than your shoulders reach up and\nthen return to the temples the hands are\nwider than the shoulders and then the\nhands to the temple keeping the forearms\nof still in space as you can the armpits\nare facing the foot bar and feel like\nthose armpits are pressing towards the\nfoot bar and this will help you\nstabilize through your shoulders the\ndeep abdominals initiate the movement\nalways inside thighs are drawing\ntogether to help you lift up out of your\npelvis out through the mouth in through\nthe nose draw the bed back into the\nstopper put those straps down eagle\nstretch cross one elbow on top of the\nother elbows up in line with your\nshoulders melt the\ncollarbones down breathing into the\nmuscles at the back of your shoulders\nthe head is dropped down slightly to\nstretch the back of the neck roll your\nshoulders around and then the other arm\non top if you can't quite cross your\nhands over then just your version is\npasa is it's fine\nso maybe just the elbows roll those\nshoulders around now we're going into\nsome standing work on the on the\nreformer so put the foot bar down you\nmight want to take your socks off\notherwise if you've got Pilates socks on\ntheir grade they've got the little grit\npads underneath otherwise you can use a\nsticky mat we're going to have one\nspring on so one full spring on you step\nup onto the reformer make sure that your\nstraight make sure that your toes are in\nline with one another we're doing\nskating one two and three make sure that\nyour feet are aligned your legs are\nparallel knees over the middle toes now\nbend your knees hinge forward and just\nmoving the carriage leg we're wanting to\nkeep the foot bar leg very still your\npelvis very still and you're pressing\nout targeting the muscles on the outside\nof your left hip so press through your\nheel think of your heel pushing the\ncarriage out and then keeping that\ncarriage leg still this is skating too\nyou're pushing the carriage out and in\nfrom the foot bar from the footplate leg\nyour leg that's on the carriage remains\nvery very still the spine is like a\nspeed skater in the Olympics you're\nleaning forward your knees are bent your\nbottom is out but your deep abdominals\nare supporting your back I have a little\nbreather because that's quite strong on\none spring if you're finding that too\ndifficult then make the spring into a\nthree-quarter weight three-quarter\ntension and now skate\nthree so you're pressing out and bending\nthe knees straightening both legs at a\ntime straighten both legs Bend both legs\nthe challenge here is to keep the torso\non the same plane as you're pushing it\nout and in pressing through those heels\nusing those outside hip muscles return\nthe bed back into the stopper straighten\nup shift your weight onto the foot bar\nleg and then step off other side step\nonto the foot bar first position your\nfeet so that they're even feet are\nparallel\nhands behind your pelvis bend your knees\nlean forward nice and deep now just the\ncarriage leg our target area is the\nright outside hip area the glutes press\nthrough the heel to really target the\nglute Man and glute men that supporting\nleg will work be working in an isometric\ncontraction here as well now switching\nso now you're moving the carriage out\nbut with the foot bar leg requires a bit\nof coordination here if this is too hard\nfor you to coordinate then do the glute\nwork from the beginner to program\nputting the hands on the knees can help\nyou once you still like when you feel\nthat you're getting fatigued there\nstand up have a little breather and then\nwhen you're ready you bend your knees\nlean forward hands behind the pelvis\nmake sure that the pelvis is even and\nthen we're pushing out and in skating\nthree having your knee your hands on\nyour knees assists a little breathing\nout through the mouth in through the\nnose initiating by pressing the heels\napart deep abdominals Kovach floor\nengage keep the pelvis and spine as\nstill as you can and that torso moving\non a horizontal plane try not to bob up\nand down straighten up lift up shift\nyour weight onto that foot bar leg and\nthen stepping off\nmake the spring lighter now either 3/4\nor 1/2 we're doing inside theis step on\nto the foot plate and then you move your\ncarriage leg to the center of the\ncarriage pressing the feet together and\nthen you push the carriage out within a\nrange that feels safe for you now draw\nthe bend into the strop up squeeze it\nsqueeze it squeeze it squeeze it squeeze\nand into the stopper open out stretch\narms to a tee now lift your arms up to a\nhigh V legs inside inside inside thighs\nor reaching out and then push down to\nlift up pelvic floor deep abdominals\ngood keep lifting the pelvic floor up\nand then squeezing the legs together\npress the bed into the stopper now you\ncan turn the legs out very so slightly\njust be careful with your feet position\nhere inhale open and then exhale drawing\nthe legs together cards inside thighs\nbuttocks stretch mobility and then\nstrength by pressing the bed into the\nstopper you've got to really switch that\non pushing out collar bones down\npressing out engage your armpits pulling\nthe inside thighs together one or two\nmore only within a range that you feel\nsafe if the spring is too light then add\non a little bit of their support there\nand then into a thoracic extension where\nyou lift your chest up and return the\nchallenge there is two when you do that\nback arch that thoracic extension to\nkeep the bed in at the stopper don't let\nthe spring and the inside thighs go\nparallel to start arms out to a tee\ninhale open exhale draw the legs\ntogether inside the eyes pelvic floor\nlift again inhale open\nthink groin knees ankles drawing\ntogether and then within a range that\nfeels safe for you press press press the\nlegs together more more more more MORE\npeople do often just draw the carriage\nin and then they just sort of like hang\nout there you've got to really actively\npress the carriage into the stopper lift\nyour arms up so now we're bringing in\nshoulder stability with the legs turn\nthe fee down into a little V pressing\nthe heels in towards one another so\nkeeping the shoulder blades stable as\nyou move the legs as well inside thighs\nheels calves inside thighs collarbones\naway from the ears\nback at the legs drawing together more\nmore more more more inhale open exhale\npressing the arms down legs together\nsqueeze and lift and then thoracic\nextension keep the bend in at the\nstopper shift your weight onto the\nfootplate stepping off there tendon\nstretch lift the bar up put a sticky mat\nunderneath your pelvis if you don't have\na little sticky mat then you can use\nlike a Pilates mat or a yoga mat sitting\non the carriage towards the front of the\ncarriage fading of a hands are on the\nbar heels together you press in a\ncarriage out flexing the heels under the\ncarrot under the bar lift the heels and\nthen return the heels remain together\nbreathe out to straighten the legs the\nheels are together breathing into flex\nheels together breathing out to lift\nheels together breathing into a turn\nkeep the heels together drop your head\ndown look towards your pelvis\nkeep looking bending your elbows as well\nlift your heels up keep looking towards\nyour pelvis to tuck your tail under\ndiving forward exhale inhale exhale lift\nthe heels and then inhale bend and\nreturn out through the mouth now as the\nheels lower down keep pressing the\ncalves the inside thighs together\nfeeling the co contraction of your\nabdominals and the back of the legs as\nyou tuck the tail towards your face\nimprinting the lower back away from you\nit's a beautiful stretch to finish the\nclass we eventually have your shins and\nyour foreign touching well done guys I\nhope you feel great after that workout\nkeep practicing that until you feel\nreally strong so how did you go I

      "content": "[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]\nwelcome back to real good Pilates I'm\nMichelle and today I have for you a\nsuper quick AB focused reformer workout\nso we're gonna get all up in the core\nand get a nice quick burn going for when\nyou are short on time all right so we\ncan start anywhere from a single red\nspring all the way up to even two Red\nSprings I'm gonna be right in the middle\nkind of a sweet spot on a red and a blue\nyou decide what feels best for you\nand then we're going to lay down on our\nbacks have your straps on your shoulder\nrests headrests can be adjusted for your\ncomfort and then we're going to get into\na little mid-back series here to get our\nABS going so get the straps in your\nhands bend your elbows decide if you\nwant to be imprinted or neutral whatever\nfeels better to you today imprint is a\nlittle bit more challenging to maintain\nelbows are going to be on the mat lift\nyour legs up to tabletop one by one so\nalready the ABS are working to support\nus here all right now extend your arms\nto straight this is going to be our\nstarting position knees are directly on\ntop of your hips if they're further from\nyou this is more challenging if you need\nto give your hip flexors a little rest\nyou can bring the knees closer to you\nnow we're going to breathe in and Float\nour arms up so the wrists are directly\nover the shoulders and then exhale to\nreturn down inhale and float up\nexhale to pull down to the mat yeah so\njust kind of feel this out see if you\nneed to make an adjustment to your\nSprings or anything else about your\npositioning the goal is to maintain the\nspinal position that you started with\nthe whole time all right now next layer\nif you're ready to add it is going to be\na knot of the chin and flexing the spine\nas the arms push forward return to the\nmat to lower down exhale curl yes if\nlifting the head up is not on the books\nfor you today it's all good leave it\ndown and continue you'll still get\nplenty of good work here good now the\nnext time you curl up we're going to add\nan extra challenge stay up with your\nbody and you're going to lift your arms\nup and down maintaining that flexion\nyou've got in the spine lift and lower\nlet's do two more it can be a smaller\nrange of the arms just try to maintain\nthe flexion through the upper back and\nthen you're going to lay your body down\nand set your feet on the bar\nso good totally different when our head\ncan't lower down good now we're going to\nrepeat that in a different positioning\nof the arms we're going to start in the\nsame start position though so take the\nArms by your sides lift your legs up now\nturn your palms in to face your hips and\nwe're going to open to a T and then\nclose down so it's an inhale\nand then exhale\nyes in this position it's much harder to\nkeep the ribs connected so as the arms\ngo out don't let the ribs flare off of\nthe mat\nall right now just like before start\nadding in the extras as you feel ready\nwhen the arms lower that's when the chin\nwill nod and our spine will lift off and\nthen lower down\nforeign\nso good always bringing that chin\ntowards the chest to anticipate that\nflexion let's do two more\nnow on your next one just like before\nkeep your body here and continue with\nthe arms open and close inhale and\nexhale only open the arms as far as you\ncan keep your curl forward don't let\nthose shoulder blades lay back last one\nand then you can open and release all\nthe way down\nso good you guys all right next we're\ngoing to go into arm circles so bend the\nelbows reach the Arms by the hips we'll\nstart in our usual start position here\nnow you're going to open the arms to\nyour T raise the arms to the ceiling and\nthen push forward\nso inhale to open and lift exhale to\npull the arms down very good now we're\ngoing to start adding in some leg\nextension if you're feeling ready for it\nso as I lower my arms I'm going to nod\nmy chin and curl up also extending the\nlegs if you feel ready open the arms to\na t to lay your body down we do that\nagain so the arms the legs the head\neverything goes forward together as the\narms open I bend and lay my head down\nlet's do three more exhale reach\ninhale to lower last two try to\ncoordinate it all together making it\nflow seamlessly\ngood all right rest down okay now we\njust need to reverse the circle of the\narms so get the arms back by the hips\ntable top the legs we're going to lift\nthe arms up first take a breath in open\nto a T and pull the hands to your side\nso we inhale reach up\nexhale pull down\nso good all right once you've got your\ncircle pattern down the head can lift\nand or the legs can straighten you could\nchoose to leave your head down and just\nfocus on the arms and the legs so it's\nwhen the arms come to the hips that's\nwhen we add the lift and the reach arms\nto the ceiling is when we lower down so\ncurl\nand then lower so good let's do three\nmore here reach those legs as low as you\ncan stabilize keep the ankles tight\ntogether\nso good last one\nand then rest all the way down amazing\namazing all right shake your knees out\nside to side\nno ab workout is really ever complete\nwithout a set of hundreds so that's what\nwe're going to finish out with here with\nour hands in the straps\npull your elbows to your sides lift your\nlegs up now I'm going to start us at the\nkind of base level and layer up the\nchallenge so you pick and choose what\nextras you want to add on here so we're\ngoing to take a breath in as we exhale I\nwant you to straighten your arms lift\nyour head up into your flexion and start\npumping your hands for your hundreds so\nlike there's little tiny drums under\nyour hands you're going to breathe in\nfor five\nand out for five counts\nin through your nose\nout through your mouth now head down is\na perfectly good modification if your\nneck is feeling too strained next\naddition to advance the challenge is to\nstraighten your legs when you exhale\nbend your legs when you inhale out two\nthree four five in two three four five\ngood you guys out and in\nnow the next layer is to leave your legs\nstraight try it out and see how it goes\npumping the hands leaving the legs long\nlet's do two more sets you decide if you\nwant to leave them straight or not last\none\nnow come to tabletop and hold crunch up\neven higher bend your elbows and lay\nyour body down\namazing all right set your straps down\ncome all the way up\nall right\nthere's our ABS okay let's we're gonna\ngo on to some kneeling ab work now so\ndecrease your Springs so we're just\ngoing to go to one single heavy red\nspring so kneel down facing one side\nyou're going to come up off of your\nheels have your knees and ankles all the\nway together that's very important you\nwant to kneel down pretty close to your\nshoulder rests and then your nearest\nhand is going to go on the foot bar now\nas I grab the foot bar I'm going to keep\nmy body in a straight line and lean over\nso that my top knee actually comes off\nthe carriage to stack onto my bottom\nknee okay if that doesn't happen I can't\nbe in a straight line I end up being\nkind of curved if both my knees are down\nso very crucial top Shin balances on the\nbottom Shin all right now your top hand\ncan just go on your hip you're going to\nsqueeze your glutes and your inner\nthighs to find this nice open position\nthrough the hips now as I breathe out\nI'm going to push with the top of my\nshoulder to move my Carriage away and\nthen as I exhale I'm going to squeeze\nfrom underneath my armpit to come back\nso I push out and then I pull yeah so\nthis can be kind of a funny position\nit's a little bit different since our\nknees are kind of the leader they're the\nfurthest point out I almost like to\nthink that I'm pushing the carriage out\nwith my bottom knee\nthat's it and both sides of the waist\nstay equally long\ngood couple more times and then this\nother arm is getting in like a shoulder\nraise\nso we get work for the top and then also\nunderneath the armpit for the lats\nso good all right now push out there and\nstay now we're gonna move the waistline\nI'm going to drop my hip towards the\ncarriage and then I'm going to lift my\nhips up and pull the carriage underneath\nme so I'm side bending in both\ndirections I drop\nand then I squeeze good I stretch out\nthe bottom side of my waist and then the\ntop side of my waist so good so now the\nshoulder is just maintaining its\nposition and I'm getting this movement\nthrough my side body droop\nand then back up let's do three more\nreally squeeze this bottom rib to hip as\nwe come in\nlast two\nso nice last one\nand then we can relax\ngood all right let's turn around try\nthat on the other side\nso same setup knees and ankles together\ngrab your foot bar you want to have your\nhand slightly forward on the foot bar so\nit's angled slightly forward of your\nbody squeeze the glutes hand to the hip\nand then we start pushing and pulling\nyeah ideally your thumb is on the top\nside of the foot bar if you feel secure\nenough yeah that'll keep your wrist in\nan even better position good keep your\nglute Super Active so it's the whole\nbody working together\ngood let's do two more inhale to push\nexhale to pull last one\nnow let's push out there and hold you're\ngoing to maintain the shoulder in its\nposition and move your waist you're\ngoing to side Bend and pull the carriage\nunder you and then dip the hip towards\nthe floor so I side Bend and squeeze and\nthen it's a reverse side Bend to droop\nthe pelvis down\nyes so we're getting this lengthening\nand shortening through the sides of the\nwaist that's it but if we lose stability\nat the shoulder we've disconnected from\neverything so we find stability here and\nthen Mobility through the spine last two\nlast one\noh so so good all right now stay on your\none red spring if you feel like you need\nmore support or if you start feeling\nthis in your lower back add on maybe a\nquarter or a half spring a little bit\nextra okay lighter is definitely harder\non the abdominals so we're going to set\nour hands on the foot bar have our feet\nback against the shoulder rests press\nthe hips forward and we're going to go\ninto a long stretch kind of a prep down\non our knees so the glutes are engaged\nmy hips are open now we're just going to\nmove from the shoulders to push the\ncarriage away and then I return my chest\nover the bar so I inhale\nand then exhale\nvery good push\nand then pull so I'm in this kind of\nkneeling plank position and the only\nthing moving is my shoulder everything\nelse stays stable and connected so good\nyou guys couple more press\nand return let's do three more push\npull that's it keep the glutes engaged\ntoo\nand last one\noh very good okay now we're gonna try\nthat up in a full plank position if it's\nnot happening drop back to your knees\nnow I like to do this one with my head\nrest all the way up that way I can kind\nof bring my feet closer together and\nrest the ball of my foot against the\nheadrest if you prefer to keep your feet\nwider against either shoulder rest\nthat's fine too feet together we get a\nlittle inner thigh action which is fun\nso you can choose keep the feet on the\nshoulder blocks or bring them closer\ntogether and put the toes on the\nheadrest that also sets you further back\nmaking it even harder so some food for\nthought okay now I want you to lift your\nknees up into your plank shoulders are\nover the hands and then we do that same\nmovement just in a much longer lever yes\nand a much more challenging position\npush\nand pull good squeeze the glutes try to\nstay in that long dark position\nand just saw from the shoulders good\ninhale and exhale let's do three more\npush\nand pull two more\nlast one\nall right softly set your knees down on\nthe carriage sit your hips back over\nyour heels and drop your chest through\nyour arms\nah take a breath or two here\nvery good all right slowly tuck your\ntail under\nroll your spine to come all the way up\nand with that we are all finished with\nour super quick AB focused reformer\nworkout I hope you enjoyed it I loved\nhaving you and I can't wait for you to\njoin me back here for our next reformer\nworkout very soon so I will see you then\nbye",

      "content": "Welcome to your Pilates reformer\nworkout. I'm joined by my friend\nKendrick, who you may recognize from the\nworkout we did uh last summer where he\nkicked my\nbutt. Kendrick is going to be\ninstructing me today. He's going to do\nan express abs workout. And today we're\ngoing to use the ball. Mhm. We're going\nto have some um alternative options if\nwe don't have the props, right? Yes.\nGreat. Kendrick is also joining me for\ntwo more workouts which will be\navailable on my membership. So, if\nyou're not Anna member, please go check\nthat out. Kendrick, where can the people\nfind you? You can find me on Instagram\nand my handle is NYC Kendrick and\nKendrick Reads Tarot. He also does\nvirtual privates, which I wholeheartedly\nrecommend you check out. And shall we\nget started? Let's get started. Let's do\nit. Do you want the headrest up or down,\nKendrick? Down. And how many springs are\nwe loading? We're going to put all of\nthem on to keep the carriage nice and\nstable. Beautiful. Yeah. All right. All\nright, everybody. So, Melanie is lying\ndown on her back with her head rest down\nflat. Um, I have done this exercise with\nthe heels on the bar, but you can also\ntake the heels down to the platform,\nwhich actually might be good for a lot\nof people. And then we're going to grab\nthe ball and we're going to place that\nin between the knees. Okay? And you're\nthen going to place your hands behind\nyour head and just nest your head in the\npalms of your hands with your elbows\nnice and wide. And if people I'm sorry\nto interrupt. If people don't have the\nball at home, what should they use\ninstead? If you don't have the ball at\nhome, you can literally use a folded up\ntowel, paper towel roll, a roll of paper\ntowels, little squish on it. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah. You just want something in\nbetween the knees just to keep you uh\nengaged in the inner thighs. Okay.\nYou're going to take a deep breath in\neveryone and as you exhale, squeeze the\nball gently and pull your navl in away\nfrom that ball. Then you're going to\ntake another deep breath in here. As you\nexhale, lift your head and your chest up\ntowards the ball and the knees. And\nyou're going to hold it there for eight.\nAnd this is a moment where you're really\ngoing to focus on your lower back being\nanchored into the carriage. Holding. I\ncount slow. Four. Keep breathing. Three.\nAnd two. On the inhale, you're going to\nlower down and release the grip. Inhale.\nAnd as you exhale, lift the head and the\nchest up. Squeeze the ball and pull the\nnavl into the lower back. Again, inhale\ndown. And exhale, lift up to squeeze.\nKeep doing this, everybody. Try to focus\non those lower abs as you squeeze the\nball and pull the abdominals in and\ndown. And looking up towards the ball.\nAgain, you have for four. And exhale.\nFeel those adductors working. And you\nhave three more. and exhale, lift. Good.\nTwo more. Keep synchronizing the breath.\nExhale on the exertion as you lift up.\nAnd again, one and exhale, lift up. Hold\non tighter to the ball a little bit\nfaster going down and up. Down and up.\nSo, we're really thinking about that\nupper thoracic flexion here along with\nthe cervical spine. Four and lift. Three\nand lift. And usually when my clients\nstart to get tired, I just say, \"Focus\non your breathing more. It's going to\nhelp support you. It's going to help you\nexecute.\" And down, right? Because we\ndon't want to just think about how we\nare using the muscles. Down. Four more.\nAnd four. And up. And just when they\nthink they're done, they're not for\ntwo. Last one. Hold it at the top. Stay\nthere. Now you're going to do a soft,\ncontrolled pulse up and down with the\nhead.\nup. Lift. Almost done for\nfive and four. We're going to do two\nsets of eight. Okay, so this is\nfinishing the first set. And here's the\nsecond set here. And you go eight. How\nwe going to get the rest of it?\nSix. You're almost done. Five. And four.\nAnd three. And just so we know it's not\na fluke, you're going to hold it at the\ntop for eight. And focus on the\nbreathing here. Inhale. and exhale. And\nas you're breathing, make sure that on\nyour exhale, you really feel that navl\nfunneling down to the lower back on the\ncarriage. You have two more. And two,\nand one. And lower down. Good job. Thank\nyou. I'm already sweating, man. That's\ngood. So, you can bring your knees into\nyour chest. Watch your feet. And just\nrock from side to side. Sort of\nmassaging your lower back on the\ncarriage to break up that tension that\nyou may have created there. So now\nMelanie is going to bring the ball back\nin between her knees and then the legs\nare going to go to tabletop actually\nright over the bar. You can place your\nhands behind your head again. Okay.\nShe's going to flex the feet so the\nheels are nice and flat. Take a deep\nbreath in here. As you exhale, lift your\nhead and your chest up and hold it\nthere. You're going to keep your hips\nnice and stable on the carriage. And\ntake another inhale. As you exhale,\npress the right heel forward, keeping\nthe ball in between. Good. And then\nbring it back into s center on the\ninhale and switch. Exhale, left heel\npresses out. Good. And bring it in slow.\nNow, if you don't have the ball to press\nthe heels out and feel it rolling in\nbetween the inner thighs, you can just\ntake your legs into tabletop and you can\nalternate the legs reaching out without\nthe ball or without the towel or\nwhatever you would be holding in between\nyour inner legs. Three. And bring it in.\nJust two more. And a two. And bring it\nin. And one. And bring it in. And rest\nfor a moment. Flex the heels with the\nhands behind the head. Okay. Let's take\na deep breath in. Exhale. Lift up. Hold.\nLet's say that we finish with your right\nheel. Press forward slightly. Okay. Now,\ncross your right elbow towards the left\nknee. Good. And you're going to bring\nthe knees back to center. And switch.\nExhale. Cross. If you want to lower the\nhead all the way down, you can. So that\nwould be and come back up. There you go.\nAnd lower down center. And exhale. Lift\nup and across. Almost done. Five. Feel\nthe dialogue going on between the knees\nand the navl here. Pulling in away from\nthe knees. Three. And exhale cross. Two\nmore. And inhale center. And exhale\ncross. One more. And inhale center. And\nexhale cross. Good. Bring it all in. And\nyou can rest. Nice job. Thanks. I like\nthat rolling alteration. I've never done\nthat before. You like that one? I do.\nYeah. Cool. Cool. Cool. Okay, everybody.\nMelanie just did her ab workout, her ab\nseries. We did some anterior work. Now,\nwe're going to do some posterior work.\nWe are going to place both feet on the\narches on the foot bar. And the ball is\ngoing to go in between your knees.\nAgain, your headrest is still down. Your\npalms are going to be flat to your\ncarriage. You're going to take a deep\nbreath in here. And as you exhale, just\nsqueeze the ball gently and pull the\nnavl in away from the inner thigh\nconnection. Take another deep breath in.\nAnd as you exhale, you're going to scoop\nout your core and peel your spine\nvertebrae by vertebrae from that\ncarriage, pressing the hips up,\nestablishing that diagonal line. And\nyou're going to hold for four. Feel the\nstretch across the front of the hips and\nthe engagement in the backs of the legs\nfor two. And you're going to inhale all\nthe way down, articulating your spine\nnice and supple as you sort of massage\nit back down against the carriage.\nInhale at the bottom. And as you exhale,\nscoop out the core and peel the spine\noff, establishing that diagonal line\nagain. And inhale, lowering down,\nfunneling the navl down to the lower\nback as the lower back pulls down to the\ncarriage.\nand exhale. Scoop and peel the spine\noff. Really using the arms as well. Feel\nit in the palms, the triceps, the upper\nback and shoulders. One more time to\ncome down on the inhale. Slowly\narticulating the spine against the\ncarriage. And exhale. Scoop out the\nabdominals and peel the spine off. Good.\nAnd you're going to hold it up there.\nEverybody, shift your weight onto your\nleft leg and you're going to take your\nright foot off the bar. Reach the right\nleg long. You've got your inner thighs\nfacing one another and your femurss are\nparallel. You're going to lower the hips\nall the way\ndown. And exhale, press strong through\nthe left, reach long through the right.\nGood. And three more. Inhale down. Navl\nin. And exhale. Push up. Now the\ndiagonal is from the toe all the way to\nthe shoulder. Just two more. Navl in.\nDown. And you can give yourself that\nmoment of rest on the carriage right\nbefore you press back up. Extending\nthrough the front of the left hip. Last\none. Inhale\ndown and exhale. Press up with the left.\nReach long with the right. Hold it up\nthere. Bring your right foot back down\nto the bar. And then you're going to\narticulate your spine all the way back\ndown. Good job.\nWhoa. You're handing me my ass. Rocking\nyour knees side to side.\nNow, something I like about bridges,\nwhich I think a lot of people don't\nassume is that it is a core exercise,\nright? Yeah. Yeah. So, I think often we\nthink about it as being so hamstring and\nglute focused, but all of that\narticulation goes so beautifully into\nthe core, right? The core is very\nactive. It's very responsive\nduring those bridges. I like that you\ntook us there. Well, we're going to go\nback there, but on the other side, about\nto like it on the left side. Okay. Yes.\nHere we go. Okay, everybody. Palms are\nflat. You're going to take a deep breath\nin here. As you exhale, squeeze the ball\nand pull the navel in. Scoop out the\ncore. Peeling the spine away from the\ncarriage. Feel the arms at the top of\nthe press. Hold for four. Hold for\nthree. Hold for two. Hold for one.\nYou're going to inhale. Pull the navl in\nand down towards the lower back. As you\narticulate that\nspine, feel the hips settle. And exhale.\nScoop in. Peel it back off. Reconnecting\nto the heels, the hamstrings, the\nglutes, upper back, and shoulders. Down\nthrough the fingertips. And lower\ndown.\nGood. And exhale. Scoop and peel it off.\nThere you go. Keep it going here. A lot\nof times with clients, especially if\nthey're new, right, they fidget with the\nfeet a lot or their feet aren't even\nparallel. They might be like in a\nPilates Vshape or something like that,\nright? And so it really does take a\nmoment of pause for them to feel what\ntheir feet are like in parallel. I feel\nlike sometimes the feet are a little bit\nof an afterthought. Absolutely. We take\nthem for granted. Sometimes folks have\nsome interesting rotation stuff\nhappening in the hips which goes to the\nfeet. Yes. All connected. Yeah. And\nestablish that diagonal. Hold it there.\nYou're going to shift your weight to the\nright. Left leg is up. Good. Hold. And\ninhale. Lowering\ndown. And as you exhale, press through\nthe right. Reach long through the left\ninner leg. Good. And inhale down. And\nwhat I usually say with that inner leg\nis that you're reaching from the groin\npast the knee through the ankle. Feel\nthe arch in the big toe. Twice more.\nInhale\ndown and exhale. Feel the extension in\nthe hip just like you feel on the top of\nthe ankle. And one more. Inhale down.\nNavl in. And reinvigorate those arms.\nPress. And left foot goes down. And\nyou're going to articulate the spine\ncoming all the way down. Pulling the\nnavl in to the lower back.\nGood job. Thank you. Yes. All right,\nKendrick, take us away. What's up next?\nOkay, so we are going to do a plank\nseries next. Melanie is going to go\nprone on her carriage. Her feet are\ngoing to be on the edge of the platform,\nthe top edge. So the crevice of the toes\nwhere they meet the balls of the feet\nare there. And then her hands are going\nto be on the sides of the shoulder\nblock. The wrists are going to be\nstraight aligned with the rest of the\nforearm. Okay? And then the knees are\ngoing to come back to the edge of your\ncarriage just to give you a little bit\nmore real estate and room. Take a deep\nbreath in here, Melanie. And you're\ngoing to exhale, rounding your spine,\npulling your navl in. Everybody, make\nsure that your knees are really together\nhere, as well as the ankles, cuz you\nwant that inner leg connection that\nwe've been practicing the whole time\nwith the ball. Take another deep breath\nin here. And as you exhale, you're going\nto lift your knees up off of the\ncarriage, and you're going to hold for\nfour, hold for three, hold for two. Keep\nthe core held, right? And you're going\nto inhale, lightly, tap the knees down,\nfeel the core engagement, and exhale,\nlift up.\nand inhale tap. Seven very light tap and\nexhale to\nlift and inhale tap. So these are kind\nof slow and steady. You know, it\ndefinitely does start to feel very\num strong in the core after the first\nfour. You're going to feel it right\naway. Three more. Three. Navl and exhale\nand up. So you're pulling the navl into\nthe lower back towards the ceiling. One\nmore tap. Lift it up and hold. Okay.\nTurn the knees to the left. Good. Pull\nthe abs and coming through center and\nturn them to the right and pull the abs\nin center. And turn them to the left and\nbring it center. Now bring them to the\nright. And hold them to the right. Keep\nthe knees to the right everybody.\nInhale. As you exhale, push all the way\nforward. Feel the glutes and that left\nhip. Good. Abs in. Bend the knees into\nthe right elbow. And exhale pushing out.\nFeel that extension in the front of the\nhips. Navl in away from the knees as you\ndraw them into the elbow. Two more\ntimes, everybody. Exhale.\nPush and bring it in. And I know we\ntalked about this before. Press it out\nand hold. Hold it there. You're going to\ndo a pike. Pull the hips up. Good. And\nexhale out. Just press and inhale. Pull\nup. And exhale. Pushing out. Just two\nmore. And inhale, pull up. You can do\nit. You got this. And exhale, pushing\nout. Just one more, Mel. And inhale up.\nAnd exhale, push out. And we'll take a\nbreak after this. Bring the knees in to\nthe right elbow and come through center.\nAnd then you're going to bring it down.\nWow, that was great. And horrible at the\nsame time. Yay. Oh my gosh. Okay, we do\nit on the other side. Yes, we do it on\nthe other side. Okay. All right,\neverybody. You're going to take a deep\nbreath in. As you exhale, you're going\nto round your spine, pulling the navl\ninto the lower back. Take another deep\nbreath in. And as you exhale, lift the\nknees up and hold for four. Hold for\nthree. Hold for two. And you're going to\ninhale and tap the knees down. And\nexhale, lift them up. And as you do\nthis, you do still want to feel the\ntraction that your feet have on the\nplatform and the forearms and the elbows\non the carriage. If your arms start to\nfeel like they're getting a little\nloose, you can kind of gently press into\nthe shoulder blocks. And just remind\nyourself to keep the shoulders engaged\non the upper back. One more. And last\none to tap, lift up, and hold. Turn the\nknees to the right. To the right.\nUh-huh. There you go. And bring it to\nthe center. And now turn it to the left.\nAnd bring it center again. To the right.\nAnd bring it center. Last one. To the\nleft. And hold it to the left. Inhale.\nAs you exhale, push all the way forward.\nFeel the glutes and the hips connect.\nGood. Abs in. And bend the knees into\nthe left elbow. And exhale. Pushing\nforward. Good. Feel that right side very\nmuch in. There you go. Very connected\nlaterally on the right side. And exhale.\nBring it in. And last one. You're going\nto keep the legs straight. Let's take it\nup to your pike. And up. And exhale.\nPushing out through those toes. And\ninhale pulling up. Good. Feel the\nconnection through both of the legs. And\npress out. Just two more. And inhale,\npulling the navl up. And feel that core\nconnection as you push out through the\nlegs. And one more. Navl in and pulling\nup to the ceiling. Exhale pushing out.\nAnd bring it in. And then you're going\nto come to the center and bring the\nknees down.\nYes. Wow. I'm officially deceased.\nLove\nit.

practiced since the early 1900\u2019s.  The inventor, Joseph Humbertus \nPilates, taught his method to a relatively small group of people in his New York studio, located \nwithin the dance community.  This original group of people has come to be known as Pilates\u2019 \ndisciples, or the first generation of Pilates teachers: Romana Kyranowska, Kathy Grant, Ron \nFletcher, Eve Gentry, Carola Trier, Mary Bowen, and Bruce King.  Fortunately, Pilates\u2019 work \nhas been passed on through the dedication of this first generation of Pilates teachers.  Some \nof which have continued practicing, teaching students and/or developing other teachers.   \n \nOriginally a dancers\u2019 workout, it has gained significant popularity over the last decade, as can \nbe witnessed by hundreds of books, videos, DVD\u2019s, and training programs being offered in \nmainstream society.  It is being offered at large and small health clubs, community centers, \npark and recreational facilities, chiropractor offices, physical therapy clinics, and within sports \ntraining programs. \n \nThe recent surge of interest in Pilates has placed a great demand on the fitness professional, \nas well as their certifying body.  As fitness professionals, we want to deliver what is best for our \nparticipants.  Pilates has helped a lot of people gain strength, flexibility, and mobility without \npain.  We\u2019ve seen, heard or personally experienced dramatic results from following a well \nstructured Pilates program.  But, we have also seen, heard or personally experienced not so \ndesirable results from doing too much too soon.  The goal of this program is to develop Pilates \ninstructors who focus on safety and realistic expectations when designing their classes. \n \nNETA\u2019s formal Pilates training program is designed to educate fitness professionals on the \nspecifics of Pilates exercise techniques.  The focus of this course is on the education of the \nPilates principles and basic reformer exercises.  Because of the spinal emphasis placed on \nmost exercises, it is beneficial for Pilates\u2019 instructor trainees to already have a basic \nknowledge of anatomy and kinesiology.  While some basic information is provided in the \nPilates Reformer Manual, students may find it necessary to obtain further education on the \nhuman body in order to fully understand its methodology.   \n \nAdditionally, a well trained instructor has also practiced effective teaching techniques.  This \nclinic teaches how to communicate all of the course material in ways that can be readily \nunderstood and utilized by the participant.  Clinic attendees will walk away from the training \nwith an understanding of what it takes to teach Pilates and a game plan of how to do it.   \n \nThe first section provides insight to Joseph Pilates, the man behind the method.  His \nbackground and upbringing is of significance in his development as a pioneer of health.  His \npassion is what made him excel at what he did.  The many benefits of doing Pilates are \ndiscussed in this section as well as further descriptions of what Pilates exercises are. \n \nSection two explains the Pilates principles.  They are defined with the A, B, C\u2019 S: Alignment, \nBreath, Concentration on Core Strength, Control, and Stability.  There are varying \u201cprinciples\u201d \nattested to by many different individuals, authors, and certifying bodies.  Upon close inspection \n\n \n6 \nof them all, the A, B, C\u2019 S sum them up neatly.  All of these descriptions are central and agreed \nupon by most: \n\u0001 Joseph Pilates works were initially designed for those with injuries and those with \npostural issues.  The Alignment principle is comprised mainly of postural assessment.   \n\u0001 Joseph Pilates spoke of the Breath numerous times in his published works with \ninsurmountable passion.   \n\u0001 Getting \u201cinside\u201d the movement or being the participant during the exercise and not the \nobserver is attainable only with maximum Concentration.   \n\u0001 His works regarded the abdominal area and the spinal muscles to be the center or the \npowerhouse of the body.  That powerful, efficient movement emanates from the Core. \n\u0001 The original self title of his method was \u201cContrology\u201d.   \n\u0001 Modern science provides the concepts of Stabilization for particular joints and body \nparts prior to movement, namely; the head, neck, shoulders, spine, pelvis, and hips. \n \nThe exercises are detailed in section three.  Muscular reference is included for each exercise \nseries.  The last section provides greater detail of biomechanics of movement and references. \n \n \n\n \n7 \nSection 1 \nJoseph Pilates \nJoseph Humbertus Pilates was born in 1880 near D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.  As a child he \nsuffered from rickets, asthma, and rheumatic fever.  Obsessed by his afflictions he became \ndetermined to overcome them.  As a teenager he participated in gymnastics, skiing, and \nscuba-diving. He studied the musculature of the body.  Later his studies included a variety of \nEastern forms of exercise including Yoga and Karate.  Merging his experience and his studies \nhe created \u201cThe Method\u201d.  His name for it was \u201cContrology\u201d, which is a precise series of \nexercises designed to develop the body uniformly, correcting posture and revitalizing the body, \nmind and spirit. \n \nHe created the forerunners of the exercise equipment used today.  By removing bedsprings \nfrom a bed and attaching them to a wall, he created resistance exercises, which allowed his \npatients to exercise while lying down.  The patients were mobile yet stable.  Pilates also used \nchairs, and later designed other pieces of equipment such as the Pilates Reformer. \n \nAfter moving to the United States in the mid 1920\u2019s, Pilates opened a \u201cphysical fitness studio\u201d \nlocated within the dance community of New York City.  It was here that the Pilates method was \nused as a form of therapy rehabilitation for injured dancers. \n \nPilates read constantly and used mathematics and the laws of physics in his exercises.  He \ndied in 1967.  However, the basic principles of Joseph Pilates work have not changed.  The \naim of his method is awareness of movement, mental focus and control without excessive \neffort, thereby creating a body that is healthy inside and out. \n \nNETA is proud to bring Joseph Pilates work to fitness professionals.  We recognize that \nextensive training and practice is necessary to become proficient at any highly specialized skill.   \n \nWhat is Pilates? \nPilates is an exercise discipline that was developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 1900\u2019s.  It is \na systematic approach to physical conditioning that incorporates physiological and \nbiomechanical principles to ensure safe exercise that produces positive results.   \n \nThe exercises are done in various positions on either a mat or other apparatus.  Some \nexercises are performed entirely in supine, prone or side-lying positions.  Others start from a \nseated position.  Still others start on the hands and knees.  The various exercise positions help \nto promote a balanced musculoskeletal system.  Every exercise is rooted in spinal movement \nor spinal stabilization. Spinal movement in this workout involves forward and lateral flexion, \nextension, and rotation of the spine.  The limbs are often used as weights as well as tests of \ncoordination, balance, and flexibility.   \n \n\n \n8 \nPilates principles can be applied to all human movement.  The exercises simulate daily life as \nwell as athletic endeavor.  They can be done on the floor (matwork) or on special Pilates \nequipment.  This workbook covers Pilates Basic Reformer Exercises.   \nBenefits of Pilates \nPilates trains all of the muscles of the body to gain strength in the manner they were designed \nto perform.  It becomes a matter of efficiency and mind over muscle.  As with any form of \nexercise, there are innumerable benefits. \n \nProper breathing is essential throughout Pilates exercise.  Controlled breathing purifies the \nbody, reduces stress and builds endurance.  Breathing is coordinated with each exercise, \nwhich oxygenates the muscles, eventually coming full circle to help the muscles responsible \nfor breathing perform more effectively and efficiently. \n \nCore strength is one of the most important benefits of doing Pilates exercise, because all \nmovement emanates from the core.  If the core is strong, the appendages can move without \nundue stress on the spine.  A strong core also helps to improve balance and coordination. \n \nPilates exercise helps to strengthen opposing muscle groups.  A stronger muscle is more \neffective at actively stretching its opposing muscle.  This leads to overall improved flexibility.  \nThe whole body functions more efficiently. \n \nPilates exercises also improve kinesthetic awareness, which helps a person to know where \ntheir body is in space.  Spatial awareness and core control help to improve the performance of \neveryday activities, prevent injuries and facilitate rehabilitation. \n \nMind over muscle is a very important concept in Pilates as it is for any mind body exercise.  \nJoseph Pilates was convinced that his form of exercise was the best way to train the body and \nmind together to be able to perform the most amount of work with the least amount of effort.  \nThe application of mind over muscle has been shown to help decrease stress. \n \nDisease prevention is another benefit of training both mind and body.  The mind that is trained \nto listen to the body is much more capable of identifying and dealing with stresses that may \neventually cause disease. \n \nPilates Reformer Exercises \nUnlike Joseph H. Pilates\u2019 1945 publication detailing mat exercises, he did not publish one for \nthe Pilates Reformer Exercises.  The exercises have been handed down by the first generation \nof Pilates teachers.  We know that those aforementioned shared the work demonstrated to \nthem by Pilates.  Some stay true to the exact method as it was taught them, while others have \nevolved Pilates\u2019 teachings with the times.  NETA sets out to maintain the essence of the \ndiscipline by finding commonality among the various schools of thought.  Additionally, NETA \nstands by modern science as a deciding factor on the safety and efficacy of Pilates movement.   \n \n\n \n9 \nThe reformer exercises in this manual have been selected for various reasons.  In part, due to \ntheir popularity and relative ease of execution by the average exerciser.  Secondly, we have \ntried to incorporate the different positions possible on the reformer: lying supine, seated facing \nthe footbar, pulleys, and sides, arms in straps, legs in straps, kneeling, standing on the floor, \nlying prone on the long box and seated on the short box.  They have also been chosen to \nprovide a balanced workout should they be performed in their entirety.  It should be kept in \nmind that the exercises address the body as a whole.  Therefore, when one body part is \nperforming an action, other parts are stabilizing.  Not one muscle group is ever truly excluded \nfrom the workout.   \n \nNETA\u2019s Pilates Reformer repertoire breaks down the exercises into 5 categories:  Awareness, \nWarm-Up, Basic Reformer Workout, Intermediate Reformer Workout, and Advanced Reformer \nWorkout.   \n \nAwareness \n\u0001 With these exercises, the participant will realize where their body is in space.  \nThey will observe their breath; discover the connection between every body part, \nand experience body control through thought.   \nWarm-up Exercises \n\u0001 These exercises prepare the body for more intense movement.   \nBasic Reformer Workout Exercises \n\u0001 These exercises are for those who are just learning the discipline.  The primary \nfocus is on mastering the principles while learning control. \nIntermediate Reformer Workout Exercises \n\u0001 Once the basic exercises can be performed effortlessly, intermediate exercises \nare introduced.  They add further physical demand and coordination. \nAdvanced Reformer Workout Exercises \n\u0001 Advanced exercises provide an ultimate challenge to the body and mind. \n \nThis Pilates Reformer course covers Awareness, Warm Up, and Basic Reformer Workout \nexercises for apparently healthy populations.  Each practice session should include each type \nof exercise.  All of the exercises do not need to be performed in every session and they need \nnot be performed in a specific order.  However, it is highly recommended that awareness \nbegins the session, followed by warm up, concluding with the workout exercises. \nReformer versus Matwork  \nThere are more variations of exercises that can be done on the Pilates Reformer than those \ndone exclusively on the mat.  Additionally, the reformer can act as a stabilizer for certain body \nparts while others are worked.  Exercises done on the mat only are often considered more \nchallenging, because the only stabilizing force is the floor.  Exercising on the reformer can \nassist the individual better in reaching new heights of strength that they could not get to on \ntheir own with just the mat repertoire.  Many people struggle with rolling up or rolling over on \nthe mat.  The reformer exercises offer assistance with the springs and pulleys that can fill in \nwhere the individual is weak until as such time they can perform those functions on their own. \n \n \n\n \n10 \nReformer Setup & Safety \nThere are several different brands of Pilates Reformers on the market.  Some offer more \noptions than others, but all of them include the following components. \n \nCarriage \u2013 This is the moving part of the reformer.  It is the main part that most exercises are \nperformed on.  The size of the carriage depends on the brand, but most are wide enough and \nlong enough to support an average adult male.  For safety, remember that the reformer \ncarriage is a moveable object.  Mindfulness when on or around the carriage should be kept to \nprevent injury. \n \nFootbar \u2013 This is a padded \u201cbar\u201d that is attached to one end of the reformer, near the \u201chome\u201d \nposition.  It is used as a stabilizing factor to move the carriage.  Some reformers have \nadjustable footbars to accommodate for the exercisers\u2019 needs.  For safety, check to make sure \nthat it is set up so that it does not move when in use. \n \nHeadrest \u2013 This is a small padded ledge to rest the head weight on when lying supine on the \ncarriage.  Some reformers have adjustable headrests to accommodate for the exercisers\u2019 \nneeds. \n \nShoulder Rests \u2013 These are small padded ledges to stabilize the shoulders against when \nlying supine on the carriage.   \n \nSprings or Cords \u2013 Varying tensions of springs or cords are attached to the underside of the \ncarriage to increase or decrease resistance of an exercise.  For safety, check the wearing of \nthe springs or cords every time before they are used. \n \nGearbar \u2013 This is what the springs or cords attach to which produce more or less resistance.  \nFor safety, make sure the gearbar is securely in place. \n \nPulleys \u2013 These are ropes with large padded handles (straps) on the ends that also attach to \nthe underside of the carriage.  The hands or feet are inserted into the straps depending on the \nexercise.  For safety, check for excessive wearing regularly.  Check the length every time \nbefore use to ensure they are set evenly. \n \nCleaning \u2013 The reformer parts including the carriage, head rest, footbar, and foot straps \nshould be cleaned and or sanitized after every use.  The mechanical parts of the machine \nshould be checked and cleaned regularly. \n \n\n \n11 \nThe Reformer  \n \n \n \n      Footbar \n \n \n \n \nShoulder Rests \n \n \n \n \n       \n Springs \n \n \n \n \n \n  Ropes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHead Rest \nStraps \nCarriage \n\n \n12 \nStarting Positions \nClassic Pilates on Carriage \nLie supine on the carriage.  Knees bent, hip distance apart, balls of feet on footbar.  Arms \nalongside the body, palms down, elbows softly bent. \n \nClassic Pilates on Carriage Feet in Straps \nLie supine on the carriage.  Feet in straps, legs extended either abducted or adducted.  Arms \nalongside the body, palms down, elbows softly bent. \n \nProne \nLie prone on the long box, head away from footbar.  Legs extended either abducted or \nadducted.  Elbows bent with hands to forehead, palms down.  Head, neck and shoulders \nextend unsupported beyond the long box. \n \nSitting on Sit Bones \nSit tall either on the carriage or short box.  Neutral spine. \n \nC-Curve \nSit with posterior tilt of the pelvis.  The abdominals are contracted to create full spinal flexion \nresulting in a low, middle, and upper back rounded formation creating the shape of a \u201cC\u201d.   \n \nHands and Knees \nKneel on the carriage with the head toward the footbar.  Ankles dorsi-flexed with balls of feet \nagainst respective shoulder rests.  Hands on footbar shoulder width apart.  Neutral spine. \n \nNeutral Pelvis \nAllow the lumbar spine to obtain its natural curve.  The pelvis has neither an anterior nor \nposterior tilt.  Keep the abdominals contracted and the gluteals relaxed. \n \nImprinted Pelvis \nPelvis has posterior tilt.  Keep the abdominals contracted and the gluteals relaxed. \n \nLeg Positions \nKnees Bent:  knees bent with feet on footbar. \nTable Top:  knees and hips flexed 90 degrees. \nLegs on the Diagonal:  legs are extended up to a 45 degree angle with knees straight. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \nSection 2 \nThe A, B, C\u2019 S \nThese are key concepts that make Pilates exercise safe, effective, and functional.  They \ninclude sound anatomical principles.   \n \nA = Alignment \nAchieving and maintaining proper alignment before during and after each exercise is \ndiscussed and demonstrated.   \n \nB = Breath \nThe Breath is the most vital aspect necessary for life.  Additionally, it enhances and promotes \nefficient movement through proper muscular usage.  The importance of proper breathing \ntechnique is discussed and demonstrated. \n \nC = Concentration, Core Strength, Control \nThe core muscles are central to Pilates exercises.  Core Strength is necessary to allow \neffortless pain free movement as well as provide protection to the interior of the torso.  \nConcentration ensures that each movement is done mindfully.  Control over every movement \nreduces risk of injury.  Concentration on and control of the core musculature is taught, \ndemonstrated and practiced. \n \nS = Stabilization \nStabilizing the joints of the body protect and strengthen them.  The stabilization of the core, rib \ncage, scapula, pelvis and cervical spine is required to perform each exercise safely and \neffectively.  Proper stabilization of the joints is taught, demonstrated and practiced. \n \n \n\n \n14 \nAlignment \nMuch of Pilates work is based on the identification and correction of postural alignment \ndeviations.  The first step in the process of accomplishing this task is to improve awareness of \nskeletal alignment, muscle imbalances and faulty movement patterns.  Many people do not \nrealize the inefficiencies in their posture or the impact their posture has on their health.  \nHealthy posture involves a balance of the muscles, bones, ligaments, and joints.  When \nobserving someone\u2019s profile we should be looking at how the body parts line up.   \n \nHead \n \nShoulders \n \nRib Cage \n \n \nPelvis \n \nHips \n \n \nKnees \n \n \n \n \ndirectly over the neck and shoulders \n \nover the rib cage \n \nover the pelvis \n \n \nover the legs \n \nover the knees \n \n \nover the ankles \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNeutral Spine refers to the curvature of the spine that is achieved by balanced core strength \nand flexibility.  It is characterized by slight anterior curvatures in the cervical and lumbar \nvertebrae and a slight posterior curvature in the thoracic vertebrae.  The 12 vertebrae that are \nconfigured in the anterior curvature (7 cervical and 5 lumbar) are designed to balance the 12 \nvertebrae configured in the posterior curvature (thoracic).  \n \n7 Cervical \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Lumbar \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 Thoracic \n \n\n \n15 \nPosture Analysis Worksheet \nGoal: Assess posture to determine if there are any risk factors and / or musculoskeletal \nlimitations to consider during fitness assessments and exercise programming. \n \nProtocol: Although there is no specific protocol to follow for postural analysis it would be \nbeneficial for any fitness professional to observe a client from anterior, posterior and lateral \nperspectives while standing stationary and while walking towards and away from the tester.  \nThe following is a list of characteristics to look for: \n \nHead and Neck \n\u0001  Is the head upright? \n\u0001  Is the head tilted to one side or the other? \n\u0001  Is the chin / neck protracted? \n\u0001  Is the chin / neck retracted? \n \nShoulders \n\u0001  Are the shoulders the same height? \n\u0001  Are the shoulders upright or rounded? \n\u0001  Do the scapulae protrude from the back? \n\u0001  Are both scapulae the same height? \n \nChest and Upper Back \n\u0001  Is the chest lifted? \n\u0001  Is the upper back normally rounded? \n \nSpine and Trunk \n\u0001  Are the vertebrae in a vertical line, straight or curved? \n\u0001  Is the curve in the lower back normal, arched or inclined? \n\u0001  Is the abdomen protruding? \n \nHips \n\u0001  Are the hips level?    \n\u0001  Are both sides the same height from the floor? \n \n \nKnees \n\u0001  Are the kneecaps facing straight ahead like headlights? \n\u0001  Are the kneecaps at the same height? \n\u0001  Are the knees pushed backwards? \n \nAnkles and Feet \n\u0001  Are the feet straight-ahead or pointed out? \n\u0001  Where does the majority of the weight of the body lie? \n\u0001  On the outside, inside or midline of the feet? \n\n \n16 \nPosture Rating Chart \n Posture Rating Chart \n \nGood \nFair \nPoor* \nHead  \n(anterior or posterior view) \nHead is erect, gravity \nline passes directly \nthough the center \n \nHead is slightly twisted \nor turned to one side \nHead is markedly twisted \nor turned to one side \nNeck  \n(lateral view) \nNeck is erect, chin \nslightly retracted and \nhead directly above \nshoulders \n \nNeck and chin slightly \nprotracted \nNeck and chin markedly \nprotracted \nShoulders  \n(anterior or posterior view) \nBoth shoulders are \nlevel (horizontally) \nOne shoulder is slightly \nhigher than the other \nOne shoulder is markedly \nhigher than the other \n \nSpine  \n(posterior view) \nSpine is in a straight \nline  \nSpine is slightly curved \nlaterally \n(Scoliosis) \n \nSpine is markedly curved \nlaterally \n(Scoliosis) \nUpper Back  \n(lateral view) \nNormal rounding \nconsistent with upper \nthoracic curvature \n \nSlightly more rounding \nthan typical thoracic \ncurvature \n \nMarked rounding \nconstant with Kyphosis \nSpine / Trunk  \n(lateral view) \nSpine is erect and \naligned directly over the \npelvic girdle \n \nSpine exhibits a slight \nposterior alignment \nSpine exhibits a marked \nposterior alignment \nAbdomen  \n(lateral view) \nAbdomen is flat or \nslightly rounded  \n \nAbdomen is protruding  \nAbdomen is protruding \nand sagging \nLower Back  \n(lateral view) \nLower back has a \nnormal \u2018S\u2019 curvature \nconsistent with the \nLumbar vertebrae \nLower back appears \nslightly hollow.

This \nis common in older persons who suffer from \nosteoporosis or atrophy of the muscles that \ncontrol the scapula (Trapezius and \nRhomboids).   \n \n \nLordosis  \n \nCharacterized by excessive anterior curvature \nof the lumbar spine.  Weak abdominals, overly \ntight hip flexors and spinal erectors and \noverstretched hamstring muscles can \ncontribute to lordosis, which causes low back \npain.   \n \n \nScoliosis  \n \nSpinal alignment abnormality characterized by \nan exaggerated lateral \u2018S\u2019 shaped curvature of \nthe spine, which causes the shoulders and \npelvis to appear uneven.  Scoliosis can be \ncaused by muscular imbalances that, over \ntime, cause irreversible deviations in skeletal \nalignment. \n \n \nScoliosis disrupts the levelness of the hips \nand shoulders \n \n \n \n \n\n \n18 \nBreath \nCorrect breathing is defined as utilizing the full capacity of the thoracic and abdominal cavities \nto supply oxygen to the lungs to remove carbon dioxide, and other respiratory waste products.  \nThe respiratory system facilitates this exchange between trillions of cells in our bodies.  \nWithout that exchange, our bodies accumulate toxins to the point of toxic overload.  This leads \nto fatigue, illness, and disease.   \n \nThe main respiratory muscles include the Diaphragm, the External Intercostals, the Internal \nIntercostals and the Transverse Abdominis. \n \n \nDiaphragm \n \nExternal Intercostals \n \nInternal Intercostals \n \nTransverse \nAbdominis \nMany of us underutilize these muscles, which cause the strength and elasticity of them to \ndiminish.  This in turn diminishes the depth of each breath taken.  Breathing skills are taken for \ngranted because we don\u2019t have to think about them.  But they are skills that become lost in the \ndaily stresses of life.  When stressed or anxious, the body responds by increasing the rate of \nrespiration.  We end up taking small, quick, shallow breaths - sometimes to the point of \nhyperventilation.  Deep breathing helps rid the body of unnecessary tension as it oxygenates \nthe tissues, mobilizes the rib cage, and massages the internal organs. \n \nHow the Respiratory Muscles Work \nThe Diaphragm is the main muscle involved in breathing.  It is located between the abdominal \nand the thoracic cavities.  The Internal and External Intercostals muscles are located in and \naround the ribcage.  The Transverse Abdominis is located deep within the lower abdominal \ncavity.  They all work together to expand and compress both cavities to allow oxygen to travel \nin and out. \n \nWhat Happens during Inhalation \nThe External Intercostal muscles elevate the ribs and the Transverse Abdominis muscle \nrelaxes.  At the same time, the Diaphragm contracts and pushes down into the abdominal \ncavity, creating more space for the lungs to fully expand. \n \nWhat Happens during Exhalation \nThe Internal Intercostal muscles depress the ribs and the Transverse Abdominis muscle \ncontracts.  At the same time, the Diaphragm relaxes.  This creates pressure in the abdominal \ncavity to equalize, pushing the breath out. \n\n \n19 \nWe perform breathing exercises prior to starting a Pilates workout to incorporate better \nbreathing practices during the exercise session.  Practicing proper breathing techniques \nrepetitively will occur more often in daily life. \n \nBreathing and Movement Patterns \nIt is natural for the spine to extend when inhaling because extending opens up the front of the \nbody and the ribcage.  Inhaling is considered a complementary breath pattern for spinal \nextension.  This can be quickly and easily observed every time you inhale. \n \nIt is natural for the spine to flex when exhaling because flexing compresses the ribcage as it \nforces air out of the lungs.  Exhaling is considered a complementary breath pattern for spinal \nflexion.  This can be quickly and easily observed every time you exhale. \n \nExhale                              Inhale                                    Exhale                                Exhale \n \n \nComplementary Breathing Pattern for Spinal Movements \n \nFor example, look at the Mermaid exercise.  During each inhale, the spine is either maintaining \nextension or moving toward it.  During each exhale, the spine is either flexing forward, flexing \nlaterally, or rotating.  The breathing and movement patterns assigned to Pilates exercises can \nalways be reversed, and often are.  The most important thing is to keep breathing and not hold \nthe breath.  If the assigned breath pattern is difficult for someone when performing Pilates \nexercises, they may change the inhales and exhales.  Just make sure they are breathing!  At \nsome point the individual will need to challenge themselves and it is at this time they can \nchange the breath to the assigned breathing pattern. \n \nFurthermore, once an exercise is mastered with a certain breath pattern, it is an added \nchallenge to reverse the breathing so that it is performed with a different breath pattern. \n \n \n \n\n \n20 \nBreathing Techniques \nWith the Pilates Breath, we inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth.   \n \nInhale through the nose \n\u2022 The nose is a filter for our respiratory system.  It is the first attempt to reduce the \namount of toxins in our body. \n\u2022 Breathing through the nose warms the air slightly before it travels throughout our lungs. \n \nExhale through the mouth \n\u2022 Exhaling through the mouth provides a more effective forced exhalation. \n\u2022 Forced exhalation engages the respiratory muscles, compresses the abdominal cavity, \nand assists abdominal muscle contraction. \n\u2022 The abdominal muscles are the primary protectors of the spine.  Any time the \nabdominals are not contracted, the spine is unprotected. \n \nTo quote Joseph Pilates:  \u201csqueeze every atom of impure air from your lungs in much the \nsame manner that you would wring every drop of water out of a wet cloth\u201d. \n \nBreathing Awareness Exercises \n \nNormal Breathing \nPurpose:   \nCreate greater awareness of normal breath pattern. \nExercise Sequence:   \nObserve normal breath pattern.  Inhale as you normally do and observe \nwhere the breath travels inside your body.  Does the belly rise?  Does the \nchest rise?  Is it a full abdominal cavity breath?  Do the abdominal muscles \ncontract during the exhalation?  Is all of the air being exhaled? \n \nDeep Breathing \nPurpose:   \nIncrease awareness of how much inhalation is possible while strengthening \nthe breathing muscles. \nExercise Sequence:  \nInhale through the nose slowly until you can\u2019t inhale any more.  Exhale \nnaturally. \n\n \n21 \nComplete Exhalation Breathing \nPurpose:   \nTo practice full and complete exhalation and to become aware of how much \nmore air can be exhaled than normal. \nExercise Sequence:  \nInhale through the nose slowly.  Exhale through the mouth as if blowing a \npinwheel around in a circle.  Continue exhaling until you can\u2019t any longer.  \nBreathe in naturally. \n \n \n \n \n \nBack and Side Breathing \nPurpose:   \nControlling the breath as it travels into the body to create awareness of \u201cback\u201d \nand \u201cside rib\u201d breathing. \nStarting Position:   \nOne hand placed on lower abdomen and the other on the chest. \nExercise Sequence:   \n\u2022 \nInhale; allow the chest to expand so that chest rises into hand.  Do not let the belly rise. \n\u2022 \nExhale; naturally. \n\u2022 \nInhale; allow the belly to expand so the belly rises into hand.  Do not let the chest rise. \n\u2022 \nExhale; naturally. \n\u2022 \nInhale; do not allow either the belly or the chest to rise.  Focus on breathing into the side of ribs \nand the back. \n \nRib Cage Breathing  \nPurpose:   \nTo feel the ribs expand laterally as you focus on compressing the abdomen \nduring both inhalation and exhalation. \nStarting Position:   \nHands on rib cage. \nExercise Sequence:   \n\u2022 \nInhale; contract the Rectus Abdominis and Transverse Abdominis.  Try to expand to the side of \nyour body.  The fingertips will slide away from one another. \n\u2022 \nExhale; compress the Transverse Abdominis even more.  The hands come closer together as \nthe rib cage comes in and down. \n \n \n\n \n22 \nConcentration on Core Strength and Control \nConcentration on Core Strength and Control must be applied to each exercise to perform them \ncorrectly.   \n \nConcentration \nConcentration requires the realization that every movement of every body part is important and \nthat all movements are integrated.  Concentrate on each small movement and allow the \nmovements to flow.  Dismiss all activity around you and concentrate on your body as it \nresponds to the minds direction.  This meditative kind of concentration will bring clarity of \nthought, better mental focus, less mind wandering, increased mental energy and a calmer, \npositive frame of mind. \n \nCore Strength \nThe core is the pivotal point of the body.  All movements emanate from this center and are \ntransferred outward.  The core includes the deep internal muscles of the spine and central \nregion, as well as the superficial muscles.   \n \nThe Deep Internal Muscles Include: \n\u2022 Transverse Abdominis  \n\u2022 Internal Oblique \n\u2022 Multifidus \n\u2022 Pelvic Floor Muscles \n\u2022 Diaphragm  \n\u2022 Longissimus \n\u2022 Iliocostalis   \n \nThe Larger Superficial Muscles Include: \n\u2022 Rectus Abdominis \n\u2022 External Oblique \n\u2022 Quadratus Lumborum \n \nTraditional abdominal exercises, like the abdominal crunch, target the superficial muscles.  \nWhat has happened to the common exerciser is that their superficial muscles become very \nstrong, but the deeper internal muscles remain weak.  For most of the daily activities these \nindividuals perform, their larger stronger muscles are employed to complete a given task.  At \nsome point, the larger muscles become fatigued and cannot complete a given task by \nthemselves, so they call upon the deeper internal muscles for stabilization and support.  It is \noften at this juncture that the individual experiences an injury because those internal muscles \nare not accustomed to being utilized and fail under the demand placed on them.   \n \nPilates exercises focus on the entire core, including the deep internal muscles and the \nsuperficial ones.  The smaller deep internal muscles perform smaller movements.  The larger \nsuperficial muscles perform larger movements.  In order to isolate and use the deep muscles, \nthe superficial muscles are used as little as possible.  Therefore, some Pilates exercises do \n\n \n23 \nnot involve a lot of isotonic movement that is often witnessed by sight.  Consequently if the \nindividual is isolating the deep muscles they will feel the work instead of see the work.  The \ncommon exerciser is more accustomed to believe they are \u201cdoing something\u201d if they can see \ntheir bones moving.  If their bones are not moving, they assume that they are not working.  \nThey are not accustomed to feeling the exercises and assessing the quality of the exercise \nbased on their own intuition.   \n \nIt is often necessary to re-educate the participant\u2019s mental perception of a quality workout as \nwell as their physical perception of feeling the work instead of seeing it. \n \nControl \nControl over every movement is necessary to prevent injury.  It begins with awareness of the \nsmallest movements, allows mindful adjustments to maximize the effectiveness of the \nexercise, while minimizing the associated risks.  By focusing on control, the body is able to \nutilize the internal and superficial muscles to achieve a balanced body.   \n \nMovement that emanates from the core can occur at the head and neck, scapulae, spine, rib \ncage and pelvis.  One must not only learn the following principles but also internalize the \ncontrol required for each body part.  These principles should be applied consistently to daily \nlife as well as the Pilates exercises. \n \n \n\n \n24 \nStabilization \n \nCervical Spine (Head & Neck) Stabilization \n \nNeutral neck alignment:  There should be a natural inward curvature of the cervical spine and \nwhile standing or sitting, the head should balance directly on top of the cervical spine.    \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nNeutral Alignment \u263a\n\u263a\n\u263a\n\u263a \n \nNeck Flexion \u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003 \n \n \nNeck Extension \u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003 \n \nHead Nod Awareness Exercise \n \nPurpose:  Increase awareness of neck position.  Create length through the back of the neck \nby stretching the neck extensors. \n \nStarting Position:  Seated or Classic Pilates on Carriage; neutral pelvis. \n \nExercise Sequence:   \n\u2022 Inhale; nod the chin toward the chest.   \n\u2022 Exhale; return the head to starting position.  It is a slight nod, not a jam into the chest.  \nThe chin does not touch the chest.  Think of lengthening the back of the neck into the \nmat.  Keep the distance between the chin and the chest approximately the size of a fist \nor small apple. \n \nNumber of Repetitions:  3-5. \n \n \n\n \n25 \nScapula Stabilization \nScapula stabilization requires a delicate balance of movements controlled by the muscles of \nthe arm at the shoulder.  Without proper stabilization of the scapula, various shoulder joint \npositions can cause injury.  Elevation, depression, protraction and retraction are the \nmovements that the scapula performs. \nScapula Elevation and Depression Awareness Exercise \nPurpose:  Experience the range of motion available in the shoulder joint.  Create greater \nawareness of the position of the shoulder when performing Pilates exercises. \n \nStarting Position: Seated or Classic Pilates on Carriage; neutral pelvis. \n \nExercise Sequence:   \n \n\u2022 Inhale; lift the shoulders closer to the ears \nas if shrugging.   \n\u2022 Exhale; lower the shoulders away from the \nears.  Think of creating space between the \nshoulder and the ear lobe. \n \nNumber of Repetitions:  3-5. \n \n \n \nScapula Elevation \u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003 \n \n \n \n \nScapula Depression \u263a\n\u263a\n\u263a\n\u263a   \n \n \n \nScapula Protraction and Retraction Awareness Exercise \nPurpose:  Experience the range of motion available in the shoulder joint.  Create greater \nawareness of the position of the shoulder when performing Pilates exercises. \n \nStarting Position:  Seated or Classic Pilates on Carriage; neutral pelvis, arms perpendicular \nto the mat with the fingertips reaching toward the ceiling, palms facing each other, hands \nshoulder width apart. \n \nExercise Sequence:   \n\u2022 Inhale; lift the shoulders off the mat \nallowing the fingertips to reach closer to \nthe ceiling.   \n\u2022 Exhale; lower the shoulders back down \ninto the mat.  Think of separating the \nshoulder blades during the lift (protraction).  \nThink of \u201csliding the shoulder blades into \nyour back pockets\u201d during the down phase \n(retraction). \n \nNumber of Repetitions:  3-5. \n \n \nScapula Protraction \u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003 \n \n \n \n \nScapula Retracted \u263a\n\u263a\n\u263a\n\u263a   \n \n \n \n\n \n26 \nRib Cage Stabilization \nThe abdominals are attached to the ribcage by the Aponeurosis (a-pon-you-r-sis), which is the \nbroad, flattened tendon that the Transverse Abdominis, Internal and External Obliques insert \ninto on the anterior, midline of the trunk.  In between the ribs are muscles called Internal and \nExternal Intercostals (Anterior and Posterior).  These muscles are important in breathing and in \nstabilizing the ribcage while the arms, legs and spine move.  Contracting the abdominals and \nthe Internal and External Intercostals prevent the ribcage from \u201cpopping\u201d, an undesirable \nalignment.  \u201cPopping\u201d refers to when the ribcage presses outward and the low back arches off \nthe mat when lying in a supine position. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRibcage Popping  \u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRib Cage Correct Placement \u263a\n\u263a\n\u263a\n\u263a \n \n \n \n\n \n27 \nPelvic Stabilization \nThere are two positions the pelvis attains during Pilates exercise:  neutral and imprint.  Both \npositions are designed to maintain the stability of the pelvis while the arms, ribcage and legs \nmove.   \n \nNeutral pelvis refers to the position that the pelvis is in when it is neither tilted \nanteriorly nor posteriorly and the person\u2019s natural lordotic curve is present.  Many \nexercises are performed in neutral pelvis so that the muscles affecting it are worked in this \ndesired natural state.  It is important to keep the abdominals contracted even when the pelvis \nis neutral.  Even though a natural low back curve is desired, neutral pelvis is not considered a \nrest position. \n \nImprinted pelvis is used when neutral pelvic alignment cannot be effectively maintained \nduring a particular exercise.  Imprinted pelvis refers to the position that the pelvis is in when \nit has a posterior tilt.  Ideally this position is achieved by contracting the abdominal muscles, \nnot the Gluteal muscles.  The more the Gluteal muscles work to secure an imprint, the less the \nabdominal muscles will need to work.  Therefore, contracting the Gluteal muscles will not \nproduce the most desirable results for strengthening the Transverse Abdominis.   \nPelvic Placement Awareness Exercise \nPurpose:  Learn the difference between neutral pelvis and imprinted pelvis. \n \nStarting Position:  Classic Pilates on Carriage. \n \nExercise Sequence 1:  Begin Pilates breathing and place hands on lower abdomen.  Notice \nthe angle of hands as they rest between hip bones and pubic bone.  When the hip bones and \npubic bone are in the same plane, the hands will be parallel to the mat.  This is considered \nneutral. \n \nExercise Sequence 2:  Continue Pilates breathing, and pull belly button in during the \nexhalation with enough muscle contraction to allow the pubic bone to elevate higher than the \nhip bones.  Notice the angle of hands change as the pubic bone becomes higher than the hip \nbones.  This is considered imprinted pelvis.  The gluteal muscles are to remain inactive.  The \nnormal curve of the low back will be decreased as the low back descends toward the mat. \n \nNumber of Repetitions:  3-5. \n \nCommon Errors:   \n\u2022 Squeezing the gluteals to facilitate an imprint. \n\u2022 Focusing on pressing the low back into the mat instead of using the abdominal muscles \nto create movement. \n \nMuscles Targeted:  Transverse Abdominis. \n \n \n\n \n28 \n                \n                              \n \n                      Supine View                                                 Standing View \n \nPelvic Floor \nWeak pelvic floor muscles may lead to incontinence (leaking of urine).  The topic of \nincontinence may be uncomfortable, as is discussion of the pelvic floor.  Many people do not \nfrequently think of using their pelvic floor.  Yet these muscles are used during daily urination.  \nDiscovering them is as simple as stopping the flow of urine.  The flow should be broken off \nsmoothly with no dribbling.  The muscles used to do this are the pelvic floor muscles.  Once \nthe pelvic floor muscles have been identified, complete the urination.  This exercise is good for \nidentifying the muscles.  It is not recommended to stop the flow of urine in this manner on a \nregular basis.  It is recommended to contract these muscles daily for short periods of time to \nstrengthen the pelvic floor muscles.  It is also recommended that the pelvic floor muscles be \nexercised in moderation.  Just like all of the muscles in the body, they can be overworked.   \n \nImagine the pelvic floor is an elevator and, as it ascends to each floor, pull up the pelvic floor \nmuscles a little more each time, until they are completely tight. Then, the elevator can descend \nfloor by floor, gradually relaxing the muscles in stages until fully relaxed.  These are called \n\u201cKegel\u201d (k\u0101'gel) exercises.  Kegel exercises were originally developed by Dr. Arnold Kegel in \n1948 as a method of controlling incontinence in women following childbirth. \n \nThe pelvic floor is contracted (Kegel\u2019s) while performing Pilates exercises.   \n \nPelvic Floor, Abdominal Contraction and the Breath \nProper breathing is essential to the correct execution of Pilates exercises.  Concentration on \nthe breath provides time to mentally prepare for movement.  Another part of the mental \npreparation involves isometric contraction of the pelvic floor and the abdominals. They support \nand contribute to posture, breathing and circulation.  The stronger the pelvic floor muscles, the \nbetter the functioning of the lower organs such as the uterus, bladder and bowels.  The pelvic \nfloor musculature is frequently forgotten as a necessary part of daily exercise.  Yet it is evident \nthat as we age, those muscles naturally lose strength if they are not used.  Therefore, with \neach inhale, the pelvic floor muscles are \u201cpulled up\u201d (contracting the muscles used to stop the \nflow of urine).  Additionally, the abdominals are \u201cpulled in\u201d (pulling the navel toward the spine \nas if trying to zip up tight jeans).   \nPosterior Tilt \n \n \n \n \nAnterior Tilt \n \n \n \n \nNeutral \n Neutral            Anterior            Posterior \n\n \n29 \n \nDuring exhalation, maintain the pelvic floor and the abdominal contractions.  Additionally, the \nTransverse Abdominis contracts to compress the abdomen.  When these three points (pelvic \nfloor, Rectus Abdominis and Transverse Abdominis) are simultaneously contracted, it provides \nstability and a produces a feeling of connectedness within the entire pelvic region.   \n \nHow to Kegel \n1. Short (2 seconds). Contract (tighten) your pelvic muscle very hard for two seconds, and \nthen immediately relax for two seconds. \n \n2. Long (3, 5, or 10 seconds). Begin with the procedure outlined above, tightening for three \nseconds, and then relaxing for three seconds.  Over time, increase the length of time you \ntighten or relax the pelvic muscle to five seconds, then ten seconds or even longer. \n \nKegel exercises can be practiced anywhere and anytime. You should perform these exercises \nin several different positions:  Sitting, Standing, Lying Down, and Exercising! \n\n \n30 \nSection 3 \nWarm Up Exercises \nThe Footwork Series \n \nFootwork is a fundamental aspect in the Pilates Reformer workout.  It is the first series of \nexercises done on the Reformer in most any session.  Even though it is called footwork, it uses \nthe large muscles of the legs (Quadriceps, Hamstrings, and Glutes) to warm-up the body.  The \nmuscles of the lower leg (Gastrocnemius, Soleus, and Anterior Tibialis) work to move the ankle \njoint from plantar to dorsi-flexion, and the intrinsic muscles of the feet gain strength and \nflexibility. \n \nThere are several variations of footwork that can be added into a workout program to address \nthe exercisers\u2019 needs.  For example: \n \n1. Dancers who practice most of the time in lateral rotation of the hip can work on \nbalancing the muscles of the legs by working in medial rotation on the reformer.   \n2. For someone who is pigeon toed (feet medially rotated), they can balance the muscles \nof the leg and feet by working in a lateral rotation on the reformer. \n3. For people who do not have obvious variances one way or another, they can focus on \nworking all three (parallel, lateral, medial) foot positions to promote balance. \n \nFoot Positioning    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdducted \nHip Distance \nHeels Together \nToes Apart \nToes Together \nHeels Apart \n  A l s o  m e a n s   \n A l s o  m e a n s   \nA l s o  m e a n s   \n A l s o  m e a n s  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParallel \nParallel \nLateral \nMedial \n \n \n\n \n31 \nReformer Settings for all Footwork \nCarriage Setting:   \n\u2022 \nWhile supine on carriage with feet on footbar, ninety degree flexion at the hip joint is preferred, \nbut may adjust to greater than ninety degrees to accommodate the exerciser for comfort. \nHeadrest Setting:   \n\u2022 \nThe headrest should be in the position that is the most comfortable for the exerciser.

We are dedicated to offering \ncertification programs and continuing education workshops that teach the concepts and theories of health and \nfitness.  NETA emphasizes practical application of these concepts and theories as they relate to fitness \nleadership.  We believe it is important to offer education and certification to all who are interested and, in this way, \nhelp improve the quality of fitness instruction to the public. \nOur curriculum is based on the belief that fitness professionals need a thorough understanding of fitness concepts \nas well as current industry standards and research.  We believe total well-being and overall health is the primary \nobjective in learning how to teach safe and effective exercise. \n \nAcknowledgements  \nContributing Authors: \n \nLu Herbeck, B.S. \n \nSuzanne Kranitz, B.S. \nPhotography: \n \nGlen Hagen \n \nSuzanne Kranitz, B.S. \nIllustrations: \n \nMedi Clips \nExercise Models: \n \nSuzanne Kranitz, Certified Pilates Instructor \n \nStephanie Maks, Certified Pilates Instructor \nSusie Supper, Certified Pilates Instructor \n \n \n \n\uf6d9 2008 NETA National Exercise Trainers Association.
